"On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas","

      Todor M. Mishonov","Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity. We obtain that bulk viscosity can be many order of magnitude bigger than the shear viscosity. Our result for the relaxation time reveals that the Mandelstam-Leontovich approximation for the frequency dependence of the bulk viscosity is in practice an exact result for the cold plasmas. The illustrative numerical examples correspond to the plasma cocktail of the solar chromosphere at the height of the minimal polytropic index. The possible application for the acoustic heating of the inner solar atmosphere up to the transition region is shortly discussed together with the evaluation to confirm the theory by laboratory plasmas.

      Ken J Shen","Type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions of white dwarfs, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains uncertain. Recent discoveries of hypervelocity stars provide unique constraints, as these stars likely represent the surviving companions of such explosions. Using detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA and population synthesis with MSE, we investigate the outcomes of hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries undergoing helium accretion. We find that donors can nearly exhaust their helium and form compact, C/O cores before explosion. The predicted ejection velocities span a broad distribution reaching up to $\sim 1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, with D6-2 representing the extreme high-velocity tail of this population. We estimate analytically that the thin residual helium envelope can be stripped by the supernova ejecta, producing a C/O-rich surface composition consistent with the observed spectrum. The Type Ia supernova rate from this channel is ${\sim}(1.69\pm0.06)\times10^{-5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot^{-1}}$, consistent with 1% of the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Hot subdwarf + white dwarf binaries containing nearly exhausted He-star donors can therefore naturally explain the velocity and composition of D6-2 while providing a quantitatively consistent contribution to the observed Type Ia supernova rate. Our models predict a distribution of surviving donor remnants with various core He fractions and with ejection velocities extending down to $\sim 450\,\mathrm{ km\,s^{-1}}$. The orbital velocities of donor stars in this progenitor channel naturally yield orbital velocities consistent with US 708, LP 40-365 stars, and D6-2, indicating that a single class of thermonuclear supernova progenitors can account for their entire range of ejection velocities.

"The Atmospheric Response to Large Electron Beam Fluxes in Solar Flares III: Comprehensive Modeling of the Brightest Observed Near-Ultraviolet Continuum Source in an X9 Solar Flare","      
      Adam F. Kowalski","I report on the high resolution spectra of the remarkable X9 solar flare of 2024 Oct 03 (SOL2024-10-03T12:08) and evaluate the extent to which nonthermal electron beams that generate dense chromospheric condensations can power very bright kernels in solar flares. 1D Radiative-hydrodynamic models predict extreme H$α$ near-wing broadening, bright continuum intensities, and a rapid Fe II red wing asymmetry evolution at the brightest NUV continuum source in the flare. Detailed comparisons to the spectral observations reveal that the H$α$ line is too broad, the Fe II red wing is too bright, and the NUV continuum decays too slowly in a fiducial high-flux beam model. However, chromospheric condensations with maximum electron densities of $n_e \approx 5 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ and optical depths $τ\approx 1$ in the near wing of H$α$ are consistent with the observed intensity of a broad spectrum in the Southern ribbon. Model similarities demonstrate that Fe I emission lines and the FUV continuum intensity can form at chromospheric heights during flares, but I find that the ratios of the NUV to FUV continuum intensities are generally too large in the models. This suggests that radiative-hydrodynamic models of chromospheric condensations cool through $T \approx 30,000$ K too rapidly. The larger than expected FUV continuum intensities are not nearly bright enough to explain recent stellar megaflare spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope.

      Luke B. Handley","Giant planets and brown dwarfs are thought to form via a combination of pathways, including bottom-up mechanisms in which gas is accreted onto a solid core and top-down mechanisms in which gas collapses directly into a gravitationally-bound object. One can distinguish the prevalence of these mechanisms using host star metallicities. Bottom-up formation thrives in metal-rich environments, whereas top-down formation is weakly dependent on ambient metal content. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and the results of the California Legacy Survey (CLS), a low-bias and homogeneously analyzed radial velocity survey, we find evidence for a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at a companion mass of $γ= 27_{-8}^{+12} \, M_{\rm Jup}$ for companions with orbital separations between $1-50$ au. Companions below and above this threshold tend to orbit stars with higher ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.17 \pm 0.12$ dex) and lower ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = -0.03 \pm 0.10$ dex) metallicities, respectively. Previous studies of relatively close-in companions reported evidence of a lower transition mass of $\leq 10 \, {\rm M_{\rm Jup}}$. When applied to the CLS sample, our model predicts the probability of a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at or below $10 \, { M_{\rm Jup}}$ to be $< 1 \%$. We compare our results to estimates of $γ$ gleaned from other observational metrics and discuss implications for planet formation theory.

"Hydrodynamic instabilities in long-term three-dimensional simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae of 13 red supergiant progenitors","

      Hans-Thomas Janka","We present long-term three-dimensional (3D) simulations of Type-IIP supernovae (SNe) for 13 non-rotating, single-star, red-supergiant (RSG) progenitors with zero-age-main-sequence masses between 12.5 M$_{\odot}$ and 27.3 M$_{\odot}$. The explosions were modelled with a parametric treatment of neutrino heating to obtain defined energies, ${}^{56}$Ni yields, and neutron-star properties in agreement with previous results. Our 3D SN models were evolved from core bounce until 10 days to study how the large-scale mixing of chemical elements depends on the progenitor structure. Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (RTIs), which grow at the (C+O)/He and He/H interfaces and interact with the reverse shock forming after the SN shock has passed the He/H interface, play a crucial role in the outward mixing of ${}^{56}$Ni into the hydrogen envelope. We find most extreme ${}^{56}$Ni mixing and the highest maximum ${}^{56}$Ni velocities in lower-mass (LM) explosions despite lower explosion energies, and the weakest ${}^{56}$Ni mixing in the 3D explosions of the most massive RSGs. The efficiency of radial ${}^{56}$Ni mixing anti-correlates linearly with the helium-core mass and correlates positively with the magnitude of a local maximum of $ρr^3$ in the helium shell. This maximum causes shock deceleration and therefore facilitates high growth factors of RTI at the (C+O)/He interface in the LM explosions. Therefore fast-moving ${}^{56}$Ni created by the asymmetric neutrino-heating mechanism is carried into the ubiquitous RT-unstable region near the He/H interface and ultimately far into the envelopes of the exploding RSGs. Our correlations may aid improving mixing prescriptions in 1D SN models and deducing progenitor structures from observed SN properties.

We developed a pipeline to identify novae based on well-defined infrared criteria, and leveraging this pipeline, we successfully identified 41 optically confirmed novae in the WISE catalog. In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates.

"Star clusters in the gamma-ray sky","      
      Giada Peron","Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNRs) to reach the highest energy end of the CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies, and their energetics is enough to account for a non-negligible fraction of the Galactic CRs. Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters. I will review the results obtained with gamma-ray data towards a few massive young star clusters and discuss what implications these result have, especially concerning their contribution to the bulk of Galactic CRs.

      Callum W. Fairbairn","Shadows are commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in near-infrared and (sub)millimeter images, often cast by misaligned inner disks or other obscuring material. While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $α\sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\sim$ 32$^\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\sim$15$^\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps--they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations.

      Shyam H. Menon","Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} > 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.

      , et al. (9 additional authors not shown)","Close companions influence stellar evolution through tidal interactions, mass transfer, and mass loss effects. While such companions are detected around young stellar objects, main-sequence stars, red giants, and compact objects, direct observational evidence of close-in companions around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has remained elusive. Here, we present (sub)millimeter time-domain imaging spectroscopy revealing the Keplerian motion of a close-in companion around the AGB star pi1 Gruis. The companion, slightly more massive than the AGB star, is likely a main-sequence star. Unlike more evolved stars with companions at comparable distances, pi1 Gru's companion follows a circular orbit, suggesting an eccentricity-generating mechanism late- or post-AGB. Our analysis suggests that model-predicted circularization rates may be underestimated. Our results highlight the potential of multi-epoch (sub)millimeter interferometry in detecting the Keplerian motion of close companions to giant stars and open avenues for our understanding of tidal interaction physics and binary evolution.

An accurate determination of these spectra in the EUV and soft X-ray (XUV) band requires high-resolution spectroscopy, that is rarely feasible with current instrumentation. We employed a relatively large set of plasma emission measure distributions (EMDs) as a function of temperature, derived from FUV and X-ray emission line spectra acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra or XMM-Newton, in order to devise a relatively simple recipe for predicting EMDs and XUV spectra of stars of different spectral types, activity levels, and plasma metallicity. We show that the EMDs in the range of temperatures between 10^4 K and 10^7.5 K can be described using the stellar surface X-ray flux as a control parameter, but this parameterization also depends on the spectral type. In particular, we find that M-type stars show slightly lower emission measure at temperatures below ~10^5 K and higher emission measures for T > ~10^6.5 K with respect to FGK stars with similar surface X-ray fluxes. We evaluated the uncertainties in the broad-band EUV and X-ray fluxes derived from synthetic EMDs and spectra, considering in the error budget also the limited knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar outer atmospheres.

      , et al. (7 additional authors not shown)","Type Ibn supernovae (SNe) are characterized by narrow helium (He I) lines from photons produced by the unshocked circumstellar material (CSM). About 80 SNe Ibn have been discovered to date, and only a handful have extensive observational records. Thus, many open questions regarding the progenitor system and the origin of the CSM remain. Here we investigate potential correlations between the spectral features of the prominent He I $λ$5876 line and the optical and X-ray light curve properties of SNe Ibn. We compile the largest sample of 61 SNe Ibn to date, of which 24 SNe have photometric and spectroscopic data from the Young Supernova Experiment and 37 SNe have archival data sets. We fit 24 SNe Ibn with sufficient photometric coverage ($B$ to $z$ bands) using semi-analytical models from MOSFiT. We demonstrate that the light curves of SNe Ibn are more diverse than previous analyses suggest, with absolute $r$-band peak magnitudes of $-19.4\pm0.6$~mag and rise (from $-10$ days to peak) and decay-rates (from peak to +10 days) of $-0.08\pm0.06$ and $0.08\pm0.03$ mag/day, respectively. We find that the majority of SNe Ibn in the sub-sample are consistent with a low-energy explosion ($<10^{51}$ erg) of a star with a compact envelope surrounded by $\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ of helium-rich CSM. The inferred ejecta masses are small ($\sim 1$ M$_{\odot}$) and expand with a velocity of $\sim$5000 km/s. Our spectroscopic analysis shows that the mean velocity of the narrow component of the He I lines, associated to the CSM, peaks at $\sim1100$ km/s. The mean CSM and ejecta masses inferred for a sub-sample of SNe Ibn indicate that their progenitors are not massive ($\sim10$ M$_{\odot}$), single stars at the moment of explosion, but are likely binary systems. This agrees with the detection of potential companion stars of SNe Ibn progenitors, and the inferred CSM properties from stellar evolution models.

      Amit Kashi","Massive stars can exhibit giant eruptions with high mass loss shortly before their explosion as a core-collapse Supernova. These multiple giant eruptions (MGEs) may have a commutative effect that brings the star to a different state, possible one that favors the explosion. To address this problem, we evolve a 100 solar mass star and initiate a series of three giant eruptions lasting one year each, testing different mass loss rates and different metallicities. Following each eruption, we track the recovery phase to examine the post-eruption behavior of the star and its recovery timescale. The MGEs lead to a decrease in luminosity, accompanied by a slight increase in temperature. Later, during the recovery phases as the star starts to retain its equilibrium state, its luminosity increases. The recovery time-scale varies significantly after each eruption for independent on the mass loss rate, but it is shorter for lower metallicities. For the higher mass-loss rates during the recovery phase, the outer layers of the star exhibit oscillations and undergo compression at higher metallicity. These oscillations are most likely a consequence of thermal imbalance in the outer envelope. This behavior at higher mass-loss rates also suggests that the thermal readjustments during recovery may create favorable conditions for a subsequent eruption of the star.

      Nobumitsu Yoko","We perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of two idealized regimes of stellar convection: a cooling-driven model (Model C) and an entropy-gradient-driven model (Model S). The two regimes exhibit striking contrasts: while Model S develops large, relatively stationary eddies excited at depth, Model C is dominated near the surface by intermittent plume-like downflows that produce broad non-Gaussian velocity distributions and a turbulent energy flux that exceeds Model S by nearly an order of magnitude in the upper convection zone. Conventional gradient-diffusion (GD) closures reproduce the transport in Model S but significantly underestimate it in Model C, demonstrating that plume-driven convection lies beyond the scope of local, gradient-based models. To address this, we introduce a Time-Space Double Averaging (TSDA) method that extracts coherent fluctuations, yielding a diagnostic variable $\tilde{\boldsymbol{u}}$ that peaks where the flux is largest. Building on this insight, we propose a modified GD closure in which the turbulent diffusivity is corrected by a plume-mediated term, achieving quantitative agreement with simulation results. Although the closure requires a calibrated model parameter and a careful choice of the averaging window, it provides a physically transparent framework that links coherent plume dynamics to mean-field transport, and offers a pathway toward improved subgrid models for non-equilibrium stellar convection zones.

Previous work has suggested that a transition from ``planet-like'' to ``brown-dwarf-like'' characteristics occurs somewhere in the range $1-10 M_{\rm Jup}$, but precise the crossover mass and whether the transition is gradual or abrupt remains unknown. Here, we explore how the occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricities vary as a function of mass in a sample of 70 Doppler-detected sub-stellar objects ($0.8 < M_c/M_{\rm Jup} < 80$) from the California Legacy Survey. Our population consists of objects near and beyond the water ice line ($1 < a / \text{AU} < 10$), providing valuable clues to the details of giant planet formation physics at a location in the proto-stellar disk where planet formation efficiency is thought to be enhanced. We find that occurrence rate, host star metallicity, and orbital eccentricity all change gradually across the mass range under consideration, suggesting that ``bottom-up'' core accretion mechanisms and ``top-down'' gravitational instability mechanisms produce objects that overlap in mass. The observed eccentricity distributions could arise either from different formation channels or from post-formation dynamical interactions between massive sub-stellar objects.

      Raffaele Reda","Rapidly rotating late M dwarfs are observed in two different branches of magnetic activity, although they operate in the same stellar parameter range. Current empirical evidence indicates that M dwarfs with spectral types ranging from M3 / M4 to late-type M dwarfs, stellar masses smaller than 0.15 M$_\odot$, and rotational period shorter than four days display either a stable dipolar magnetic field or magnetic structures with significant time variability. The magnetic activity of fully convective M dwarfs is known to be regulated by a mechanism named the $α^2$ dynamo. To further constrain the physics of this mechanism, we use a low-dimensional model for thermally driven magnetoconvection producing an $α^2$ dynamo, specifically a modified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shell model. Although the model neglects density stratification, it captures the essential nonlinear dynamics of an $α^2$ dynamo. Therefore, the results should be interpreted in a qualitative sense, highlighting possible trends rather than providing direct quantitative predictions for fully convective stars. The model is validated by comparing the statistical properties of magnetic polarity reversals with paleomagnetic data, since the geodynamo provides the only natural $α^2$ dynamo with sufficiently rich reversal statistics. Our findings reveal that increased convective heat transport correlates with more frequent magnetic-polarity reversals, resulting in enhanced magnetic variability. This suggests that the observed magnetic dichotomy in late M dwarfs could be interpreted in terms of differences in global heat transport efficiency. However, additional models and observations of M dwarfs are needed to further constrain this interpretation.

The objects and salient results are as follows: (i) 6dF0752-54 is a dwarf nova with an orbital period Porb = 5.05 hr that shows a contribution from a mid-M type secondary in its mean spectrum. (ii) J0916-26 had been suspected of being a magnetic CV with an eclipse period of 3.37 hr. Our spectrum corroborates this classification. (iii) GSC 08944 is a novalike variable with Porb = 3.80 hr. Archival photometry also shows a persistent photometric period near 4.03 hr, apparently from a positive super- hump. Its emission line behavior is consistent with an SW Sextantis-type novalike. (iv) MGAB-V253, also Gaia20eys, had been identified as a short-period eclipsing novalike with Porb = 1.44 hr. Our spectrum shows shows broad emission lines consistent with this, and the extensive TESS data show a persistent modulation near 1.35 hr, evidently a negative superhump. It is less luminous than most novalikes, but significantly brighter than quiescent dwarf novae with comparably short periods. (v) Finally, DDE 45 shows a complicated variability history, cycling rapidly between high and low states for a time and more recently showing outbursts resembling a U Gem-type dwarf nova. We find a 2.07 hr radial velocity period, which also appears in archival TESS photometry. The emission lines are double-peaked, with an orbital S-wave similar to low-inclination dwarf novae.

This has driven advancements in methodologies for star detection, leading to the development of valuable databases and software. We present the scientific justification and operating principles of the IdentYS tool, which is designed to identify young stellar objects (YSOs) in star-forming regions. The tool facilitates the identification of young stars with infrared (IR) excess in remote and embedded star-forming regions, focusing primarily on Class I and II YSOs. For this purpose, near- and mid-IR photometric data and five colour-colour diagrams (J - H) vs. (H - K), K - [3.6] vs. [3.6] - [4.5], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [5.8] - [8.0], [3.6] - [4.5] vs. [8.0] - [24], and [3.4] - [4.6] vs. [4.6] - [12] are used. The purity of the YSOs sample is enhanced by excluding field contamination from stellar and extragalactic objects. As a result, we compile a list of YSO candidates displaying the source designation, astrometric, and photometric parameters, as well as information on the evolutionary stage determined by the presence of IR excess, as indicated by certain diagrams. The application of this program can greatly streamline the statistical analysis of young stellar populations across diverse star-forming regions, including distant and deeply embedded ones, which typically require processing large volumes of initial data.

      Ch. C. Moustakidis","The structure and basic properties of dense nuclear matter still remain one of the open problems of Physics. In particular, the composition of the matter that composes neutron stars is under theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the theories that have been proposed, apart from the classical one where the composition is dominated by hadrons, the existence or coexistence of deconfined quark matter is a dominant guess. An approach towards this solution is the phenomenological view according to which the existence of quarkyonic matter plays a dominant role in the construction of the equation of state (EOS). According to it the structure of the EOS is based on the existence of the quarkyonic particle which is a hybrid state of a particle that combines properties of hadronic and quark matter with a corresponding representation in momentum space. In this paper we propose a phenomenological model for hot quarkyonic matter, borrowed from corresponding applications in hadronic models, where the interaction in the quarkyonic matter depends not only on the position but also on the momentum of the quarkyonic particles. This consideration, as we demonstrate, can have a remarkable consequence on the shape of the EOS and thus on the properties of neutron stars, especially in those for which the effect of temperature is significant, offering a sufficiently flexible model. Comparison with recent observational data can place constraints on the parameterization of the particular model and help improve its reliability.

To elucidate the magnetic origins and driving mechanisms of such upflows, we perform three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the MURaM code, spanning from the upper convection zone to the low corona. We synthesize Fe\,{\sc x} 174\,Å emission to capture the plume evolution comparable to observations, examining underlying plasma flows, thermal structures, and magnetic topologies. We identify a pronounced transition from cool downflows in the lower atmosphere to hot upflows in the corona at the interface between plume-rooted like-polarity flux concentrations. These upflows are threaded by a complex, filamentary network of Quasi-Separatrix Layers (QSLs) -- a topology distinct from standard interchange reconnection scenarios. The domain-averaged mass flux over a 38-minute interval ranges from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-8}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, substantially exceeding observed solar-wind loss rates. Our results demonstrate that highly structured plasma outflows are channeled along strong QSLs at open--open field boundaries, providing a pathway to sustain the solar wind from coronal-hole plumes without requiring interchange reconnection triggered by opposite-polarity flux emergence.

We find a clear positive correlation between the rotational velocity (v sin i) and color of eMSTO stars, supporting the role of stellar rotation and gravity darkening in causing the observed color spread. Contrary to predictions from binary tidal-locking scenarios, spatial distribution analysis reveals that fast-rotating stars are preferentially concentrated in the cluster's central regions. This finding provides the observational evidence favoring star-disk interactions during the pre-main-sequence phase, rather than tidal locking in binaries, as the primary mechanism responsible for the origin of rotational spread in eMSTO stars.

      Simon Portegies Zwart","A comet appears in the Bayeux Tapestry between the scene showing the death of the English king Edward the Confessor and the election of his successor, Harold Godwinson. The Tapestry's inscription only refers to this as a star, though we can see from its depiction, shown with a hairy tail, that it is a comet, now known to us as Halleys Comet P1/Halley. Behind the exciting story of the Bayeux Tapestry, however, goes a rich mythological world of intrigue, deceit, the succession of kings, and earlier sightings of the same comet. In historical accounts of many cultures, comets are generally considered portents of change rather than disaster. Here we consider the significance of the Tapestry's comet in the context of the so-called English succession crisis of 1066 with reference to other contemporary accounts of comets. We conclude that although the tapestry's illustration is suggestive and unmistakably Halleys Comet, it is not a priority for its creators to give a precise account of its arrival in the sky, but rather connect it, likely for political reasons, albeit retrospectively, to the sequential events of Edwards death and Harolds coronation. In that, the tapestry's anonymous artists provide a unique telling of its arrival.

      Debesh Bhattacharjee","Solar flares effectively accelerate particles to non-thermal energies. These accelerated electrons are responsible for energy transport and subsequent emissions in HXR, radio, and UV/EUV radiation. Due to the steeply decreasing electron spectrum, the electron population and consequently the overall flare energetics, are predominantly influenced by low-energy non-thermal electrons. However, deducing the electron distribution in this energy-containing range remains a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the warm-target HXR emission model with kappa-form injected electrons to two well-observed GOES M-class flares. Moreover, we utilize EUV observations to constrain the flaring plasma properties, which enables us to determine the characteristics of accelerated electrons across a range from a few keV to tens of keV. We demonstrate that the warm-target model reliably constrains the properties of flare-associated electrons, even accounting for the uncertainties that had previously been unaddressed. The application of a kappa distribution for the accelerated electrons allows for meaningful comparisons with electron distributions inferred from EUV observations, specifically for energy ranges below the detection threshold of RHESSI. Our results indicate that the accelerated electrons constitute only a small fraction of the total electron population within the flaring region. Moreover, the physical parameters, such as electron escape time and acceleration time scale, inferred from both the warm-target model and the EUV observations further support the scenario in which electrons undergo thermalization within the corona. This study highlights the effectiveness of integrating the warm-target model with EUV observations to accurately characterize energy-containing electrons and their associated acceleration and transport processes.

Observations revealed a preflare sigmoidal structure and a circular flare ribbon surrounding the typical two ribbon structure, along with remote brightenings located at a considerable distance from the main flare site. To interpret these observations in terms of the three dimensional (3D) coronal magnetic field dynamics, we conducted data constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Using a non linear force free field (NLFFF) as the initial condition, we reconstructed a realistic pre flare magnetic environment, capturing a sheared sigmoid above the polarity inversion line (PIL) surmounted by a fan spine structure. Our simulations revealed that reconnection between the sigmoidal field, the adjacent fan dome field lines, and the neighboring large loops facilitated the transfer of magnetic twist and led to the formation of a large magnetic flux rope (MFR). This transfer and propagation of twist are clearly visible throughout the MFR. As reconnection progresses, the entire fan spine structure expands along with the evolving MFR. A notable outcome of the simulation is that the footpoints of the newly formed MFR align closely with the observed circular flare ribbon and the remote brightening region. Our findings suggest that a large MFR formed during the X2.1 flare, providing a coherent explanation for the observed phenomena.

The fast redshift values persist for over 15 minutes from flare onset, and can be split into two distinct stages of behavior, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for the downwards acceleration of flare ribbon plasma. The first stage of rapid downflows are synchronized with peaks in emission from the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory Hard X-ray Imager (ASO-S/HXI) and Large Yield Radiometer (LYRA) Lyman-alpha measurements, indicative that the chromospheric downflows (with a maximum redshift of 176 km/s) result from chromospheric condensations associated with impulsive energy release in the solar flare. Later in the event, strong Si IV flare ribbon downflows persist (to a maximum value of 217 km/s), despite the magnetic flux rate falling to zero, and high-energy HXR and Lyman-alpha measurements returning to background levels. This is reflective of downflows in the flare ribbon footpoints of flare-induced coronal rain. Hard X-ray spectral analysis supports this scenario, revealing strong non-thermal emission during the initial downflow stage, falling near background levels by the second stage. Despite these distinct and contrasting stages of ribbon behavior, Si IV Doppler velocities exhibit quasi-periodic pulsations with a constant ~50 s period across the 15-minute flare evolution (independently of loop length). We deduce that these pulsations are likely caused by MHD oscillations in the magnetic arcade. Finally, we utilize machine learning K-means clustering methods to quantify line profile variations during the stages of rapid downflows.

Therefore, the detection of each individual planet in this region holds a high value, providing detailed insights into how such a population came to form and evolve. Here we report the detection of TOI-333b, a Neptune desert planet with a mass, radius, and bulk density of 20.1 $\pm$ 2.4 M$_{\oplus}$, 4.26 $\pm$ 0.11 R$_{\oplus}$, and 1.42 $\pm$ 0.21 \gccc, respectively. The planet orbits a F7V star every 3.78 d, whose mass, radius and effective temperature are of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.1 \msun, 1.10 $\pm$ 0.03 \rsun, and 6241$^{+73}_{-62}$ K, respectively. TOI-333b is likely younger than 1 Gyr, which is supported by the presence of the doublet Li line around 6707.856 textup{~Å} and its comparison to Li abundances in open clusters with well constrained ages. The planet is expected to host only 8.5$^{+10.9}_{-8.3}\%$ gas-to-core mass ratio for a H/He envelope. On the other hand, irradiated ocean world models predict 20$^{+11}_{-10}\%$ H$_2$O mass fraction with a core fraction of 35$^{+20}_{-23}\%$. Therefore, we expect that TOI-333b internal composition may be dominated by a pure rocky composition with almost no H/He envelope, or a rocky world with almost equal mass fraction of water. Finally, TOI-333b is more massive and larger than 77$\%$ and 82$\%$ of its Neptune desert counterparts, respectively, while its host ranks among the hottest known for Neptune Desert planets, making this system a unique laboratory to study the evolution of such planets around hot stars.

We present and analyse the detailed physical properties of six binary stellar systems, originally proposed as possible star-black hole binaries on the basis of radial velocities from Gaia's third data release, but soon recognised as likely post-mass-transfer binary systems with stripped companions. Methods. We used multi-epoch high-resolution FEROS spectra and spectral disentangling paired with stellar templates to derive effective temperatures, $T_\mathrm{eff}$; stellar radii, R*; and projected rotational velocities, v$\sin{i}$ for both components in all systems along with the mass ratio, q = $M_\mathrm{accretor}/M_\mathrm{donor}$ and the components' flux ratio as a function of wavelength. Results. Our analysis directly confirms that all systems are post-mass-transfer binaries with two luminous stars, i.e. no black hole companions. Each system contains an A-type accretor component that is rapidly rotating and a cooler very low-mass donor (~ 0.25M$\odot$) that is overluminous. Five of the systems show no trace of any emission lines, implying that there is no current mass transfer, consistent with our inferred radii, in all cases within the Roche volume. The data are generally consistent with stable case AB mass transfer with $β$ (the fraction of mass lost from the accretor) less than 0.7. While the accretor components rotate rapidly, they rotate well below the critical rotation rate, $v_\mathrm{crit}$, even though there must have been enough mass transfer to spin them up to a significant fraction of $v_\mathrm{crit}$, according to theoretical models of angular momentum transfer. As neither magnetic braking nor tidal synchronisation should have been effective in spinning down the stars, our results suggest that either mass accretion does not increase the angular momentum of the accretors to their critical values or the systems never reached these values in the first place.

Each rate coefficient has an associated uncertainty, which is generally not taken into account when calculating the chemistry. We performed the first uncertainty analysis of a chemical model of C-rich and O-rich AGB outflows using the Rate22 reaction network. Quantifying the error on the model predictions enables us to determine the need for adding complexity to the model. Using a Monte Carlo sampling method, we quantified the impact of the uncertainties on the chemical kinetic data on the predicted fractional abundances and column densities. The errors are caused by a complex interplay of reactions forming and destroying each species. Parent species show an error on their envelope sizes, which is not caused by the uncertainty on their photodissociation rate, but rather the chemistry reforming the parent after its photodissociation. Using photodissociation models to estimate the envelope size might be an oversimplification. The error on the CO envelope impacts retrieved mass-loss rates by up to a factor of two. For daughter species, the error on the peak fractional abundance ranges from a factor of a few to three orders of magnitude, and is on average about 10\% of its value. This error is positively correlated with the error on the column density. The standard model suffices for many species, e.g., the radial distribution of cyanopolyynes and hydrocarbon radicals around IRC +10216. However, including spherical asymmetries, dust-gas chemistry, and photochemistry induced by a close-by stellar companion are still necessary to explain certain observations.

"Statistical analysis of eclipsing binaries with monotonic orbital-period variations: A-type W UMa contact systems","      
      Shinjirou Kouzuma","On the basis of monotonic orbital-period variations, this study aims to identify genuine relationships between binary parameters and the rates of mass transfer (MT), mass loss (ML), and angular momentum loss (AML). Sample binaries with monotonic period variations are collected from the literature, together with well-determined binary parameters. Assuming the monotonic variations are responsible for any one of the MT, ML, and AML, their rates are calculated with the rates of change of period. After selecting crucial parameters using partial least-squares analysis, a parameter that exhibits the closest correlation with any one of the derived rates is further selected using partial regression plots. Moreover, power-law relationships are found for the discovered correlations. The properties of the sample binaries are also investigated by examining associations between binary parameters. In the systems with negative period variations, it is found that the rate of MT from more- to less-massive stars is a function of the primary radius; the AML rate is a function of the fill-out factor. In addition, the relationships between the mass ratio and stellar masses indicate that the ML rate relative to the MT rate decreases with increasing mass ratio below ~0.46. Meanwhile, in the systems with positive variations, it is found that the rate of MT from less- to more-massive stars is a function of the luminosity ratio and/or mass ratio; the ML rate is a function of the secondary temperature. The discussion also addresses possible processes occurring in the sample binaries.

"High-Precision Multi-Period Analysis of the Ellipsoidal Variable Candidate TIC~470127886 from TESS Photometry","      
      Roo Weerasinghe","We present the first detailed photometric characterization of TIC 470127886, a previously unstudied multi-periodic variable star discovered in TESS photometry. Analysis of 145,374 high-cadence observations spanning 696 days (944-day baseline, 2023 January-2024 October) across 10 sectors (60, 59, 58, 53, 52, 73, 86, 79, 78, 85) reveals complex periodic variability with a primary period of 5.544527 +/- 0.004307 days and false alarm probability 1.47 x 10^-87. Lomb-Scargle analysis identifies three significant periods at 5.545, 5.801, and 8.874 days with amplitudes of 15,702, 12,772, and 12,670 ppm. The phase-folded light curve shows smooth, sinusoidal morphology consistent with ellipsoidal variation from tidal distortion in a close binary, with no eclipse features. A three-component sinusoidal model, appropriate for ellipsoidal variables, provides excellent fit quality. Validation tests confirm signal authenticity and persistence, and systematic checks verify no contamination from nearby stars (>3 mag fainter). We classify TIC 470127886 as an ellipsoidal variable candidate with 0.70 confidence, with multi-period behavior suggesting additional variability mechanisms beyond tidal distortion. This work demonstrates high-precision characterization of complex multi-periodic variables in TESS photometry.

This study extends our previous work on magnetic fields in L328 across different spatial scales. We used the JCMT/POL-2 data in the near vicinity of the L328 core to study the magnetic fields in its nearby regions. We identified clumps in these regions using the \texttt{FellWalker} algorithm and derived the dust temperature and column density by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) using combined JCMT and \textit{Herschel} dust continuum maps. We analyzed the magnetic field morphology in the vicinity of the L328 core and employed the structure function analysis to determine the magnetic field dispersion angle. We used the modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method to estimate magnetic field strengths and also derived the mass-to-flux ratio and Alfvén Mach number.

This study was based on the KEYSTONE asteroseismic sample of solar-like oscillators, which contained 20 stars for which we were able to determine whether the asteroseismic p-mode frequencies varied in time. These frequency shifts ($δν$) were determined using a cross-correlation method and using the individual mode frequencies, obtained by fitting power spectra. Three stars were found to exhibit $δν$ larger than their associated errors ($σ_{δν}$) using both methods, while two more stars exhibited $δν>σ_{δν}$ when the cross correlation was used and a further two stars exhibited $δν>σ_{δν}$ when the fitted frequencies were used. When considering the whole sample of 20 stars, the amplitude of $δν$ showed no dependence on the large frequency separation and metallicity. However, $δν$ was observed to increase with rotation rate and effective temperature. Our sample contained a number of evolved subgiant stars, allowing us to expand the parameter space usually considered when comparing $δν$ with stellar parameters. While $δν$ was small for all of the evolved stars, one was found to have $δν>σ_{δν}$, raising the possibility that these evolved stars may still exhibit variable magnetic activity.

We study the velocity field in a special case of an active region with two mature sunspots, where one of them formed several days later than the main one. Between the two spots, flux emergence is still ongoing influencing the velocity pattern. We observed the active region NOAA 12146 on August 24, 2014, with the GREGOR Fabry-Pérot Interferometer (GFPI) and the Blue Imaging Channel (BIC) of the GREGOR solar telescope at Observatorio del Teide on Tenerife. Context data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) complement the high-resolution data. In the penumbra of a newly formed spot, we observe opposite Doppler velocity streams of up to +-2 km/s very close to each other. These velocities extend beyond the outer penumbral boundary and cross also the polarity-inversion line. The properties of the magnetic field do not change significantly between these two streams. Although the magnetic field is almost horizontal, we do not detect large transversal velocities in horizontal flow maps obtained with the local correlation technique. The ongoing emergence of magnetic flux in an active region causes flows of opposite directions intruding the penumbra of a pre-existing sunspot.

Hansen","The astrophysical site(s) of the r-process are uncertain, with candidates such as neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational supernovae predicting different event rates, delay times, and heavy-element yields. Galactic chemical evolution models constrain these properties by comparing model predictions with observed abundances. We explore, in a systematic and data-driven way, the astrophysical conditions under which r-process enrichment can reproduce the observed trends of multiple neutron-capture elements in the Milky Way. Rather than assuming a fixed site, we adopt a flexible, parametric approach to test whether a common set of r-process parameters can explain the chemical evolution of several heavy elements. We compute a grid of one-infall, homogeneous models varying: Eu yield per event, r-process event rate, enrichment delay time, and progenitor mass range. For each of the $\sim 1.5 \times 10^5$ models, we predict [X/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] trends by scaling Eu yields with the solar r-process pattern. A multi-objective optimisation based on Pareto fronts identifies models that best reproduce the abundance trends. Best-fitting models favour short delay times ($\leq 30\ \rm Myr$), low-mass progenitors ($\sim 20-25\ \rm M_\odot$), and an effective Eu injection of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm M_\odot$ per event. Stars more massive than $\sim 80\ \rm M_\odot$ are too rare to dominate the enrichment. While heavy elements can be reproduced, lighter ones show stronger conflicts with Eu, reflecting that the solar r-process scaling relation becomes less valid toward lighter elements. No single class of r-process events, under solar-scaled yields, can explain light and heavy neutron-capture elements; at least two components are required: a main r-process consistent with solar and r-rich stars, and a weaker component producing enhanced light r-process elements, similar to that observed in r-poor stars.

Pre-launch calibration observations, post-launch Venus transit and lunar transit data were used to develop the PSF and evaluate how well it reproduced the observed scattering. The PSF reported differs from previous stray light removal efforts since we do not use Gaussians as the central mathematical component. Instead, we use a Lorenztian convolved with an Airy function. In 2018, the HMI team began providing full-disk, stray-light-corrected data daily. Intensity, Doppler, magnetogram, and vector magnetic field data are provided. The deconvolution uses a Richardson-Lucy algorithm and takes less than one second per full-disk image. The results, on average, show decreases in umbral continuum intensity, a doubling of the granulation intensity contrast, increases in the total field strength, most notably in plage by $\sim$1.4--2.5 the original value, and a partial correction for the convective blueshift. Local helioseismology analyses using corrected data yield results that are consistent with those from uncorrected data, with only negligible differences, except in sunspot regions. The new data are found in JSOC with names similar to the original but with the qualifying term '$\_dcon$' or '$\_dconS$' appended, denoting whether the deconvolution was applied to the filtergrams or Stokes images. The HMI team recommends using the corrected data for improved visual clarity, more accurate irradiance reconstruction, better co-alignment with high-resolution data, reduced errors in tracking algorithms, and improved magnetic field strengths.

      Hechao Chen","Solar prominences usually have a horizontally elongated body with many feet extending to the solar surface, resembling a multi-arch bridge with many bridge piers. The basic mechanism by which solar prominences acquire these common structures during their evolution, however, remains an unresolved question. For the first time, our three-dimensional magneto-frictional simulation, driven by supergranular motions, self-consistently replicates the commonly observed multi-arch bridge morphology and its characteristic structures of solar quiescent prominences in a magnetic flux rope. In comparison with traditional views, our simulations demonstrate that the spine, feet, and voids (bubbles) are inherent prominence structures spontaneously forming as the flux rope evolves to a mature state. The voids mainly consist of legs of sheared magnetic loops caused by unbalanced supergranular flows, and prominence feet settle at the bottom of helical field lines piled up from the photosphere to the spine. Similarities between the simulated prominences and observed real prominences by the Chinese H$α$ Solar Explorer, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory suggest the high validity of our model. This work corroborates the pivotal role of photospheric supergranulation as a helicity injection source in the formation and shaping of quiescent prominence structures within the solar atmosphere, thereby paving a new avenue for future investigations into their fine dynamics and stability.

HXR images of specific energy ranges often contain overlapping contributions of these components, complicating their interpretation. This is even more challenging as HXR imagers generally use an indirect imaging system. Our work aims to separately image individual spectral components, such as thermal loops, superhot sources, and nonthermal footpoint sources, rather than obtaining images of specific energy ranges that show a combination of all components. We introduce a new method called spectral component imaging and apply it to observations provided by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) aboard Solar Orbiter. First, the flare integrated HXR spectrum is fitted with individual spectral components to get the relative contributions of each component in each native STIX energy channel. In a second step, a set of linear equations is created based on these weights and the observed, energy-dependent STIX visibilities. The visibilities of the individual spectral components are derived by means of a linear least-squares approach and are subsequently utilized for image reconstructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of spectral component imaging on four different flares observed by STIX. This method provides powerful diagnostics, particularly for flares with hot and superhot components, allowing us to spatially separate these two thermal components. We apply our methodology to the nonthermal peak of the X7.1 flare SOL2024-10-01, and we find that the superhot component is located 4.8 Mm away from the hot thermal loops. The thermal energy of the superhot component is approximately 20% of the energy content of the hot component, highlighting the significance of superhot components in the total flare energy budget.

Our results show that all three of these quantities decrease with increasing ρ_{s} or r_{s}. Furthermore, by generating and analyzing both direct and secondary images of the accretion disk, we explore how the observational inclination angle and the DM halo parameters ρ_{s} and rs affect image profiles. Finally, the observed flux distributions are presented for different inclination angles. Our findings indicate that the accretion disk becomes colder and dimmer as the DM halo parameters increase, highlighting the significant role of DM in shaping BH observables.

"Solar Periodic Companion and Random Stellar Flybys: Dynamical Perturbations of Highly Eccentric Comets in the Oort Cloud","      
      Shahed Shayan Arani","The Gaia space telescope has transformed our understanding of random stellar encounters with the Solar System. This study examines how such perturbations influence the most eccentric comets in the Oort Cloud (OC), a thermalized reservoir of $\sim 10^{12}$ icy bodies extending from $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ AU. Recent Gaia-based analyses indicate about 20 stellar passages within 1 pc of the Sun per Myr. Using analytical estimates and direct $N$-body simulations, we quantify how these encounters modify highly eccentric orbits: individual flybys enhance comet-shower rates by factors of about 2, producing a cumulative increase of roughly 40 over a Myr. In parallel, we perform a full dynamical search through all stars with six-dimensional phase-space data in Gaia DR3 and identify a compelling candidate for a long-period stellar companion to the Sun. This star exhibits recurrent $\sim 45$ Myr perihelion passages and, in simulations, can elevate comet-shower activity by an order of magnitude. Because a perturber of this kind could also be a dispersed solar sibling, the companion hypothesis links the dynamical structure of the OC directly to the long-standing problem of identifying the Sun's birth-cluster relatives. The chemical-abundance pattern of such a star therefore becomes a critical observational test. Together, these results clarify how both stochastic encounters and potential long-period companions shape the dynamical evolution and observable output of the outermost OC, while highlighting the possibility that the OC retains a dynamical memory of the Sun's earliest stellar environment.

PNe in open clusters (OC) are rare but valuable since their study directly links their properties to those of their progenitors, something that cannot be achieved for field PNe. Here, we report the identification of one more OC-PN association to add to the small sample of, now, five pairs. The physical properties of the host cluster, PN and its central star (CSPN) have been explored using high and intermediate-resolution spectral and deep photometric data. The close agreement of the radial velocities of the PN and host cluster, together with concordance of reddening and distance, show that the PN PHR~J1724-3859 is highly likely to be physically associated with the OC Trumpler~25. Deep photometric data allowed clear identification of the CSPN. We find a CSPN effective temperature of around 250 kK and a nebular kinematic age of 23 kyrs, both at the extreme end, like the other members of this small class. The progenitor and final CSPN masses have been estimated to be 5.12$_{-0.15}^{+0.16}$ $M_\odot$ and 0.95$\pm$0.12 $M_\odot$ respectively. These latest results agree with the emerging trend for our other OC-PNe, falling below, but approximately parallel to, the latest initial-to-final-mass relation estimates derived from cluster white dwarfs and has important implications for stellar evolution models. All OC-PNe also possess some other common properties (e.g. all are Type-I PNe and bipolars) to be explored in future studies.

Observationally, it has been found that in some cases the F emission is stronger than the H emission, and vice versa. The reason for such behavior has not been thoroughly investigated. To investigate this, we studied 58 meter wave (20-500 MHz) type II solar radio bursts showing both F and H emissions, observed during the period from 13 June 2010 to 25 December 2024, using data obtained with the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (CALLISTO) spectrometers at different locations and Gauribidanur LOw-frequency Solar Spectrograph (GLOSS). We examined the intensity ratios of the H ($I_H$) and F ($I_F$) emissions and analyzed their variation with heliographic longitude. We found that 14 out of 19 bursts originating from heliographic longitudes beyond $\pm75^\circ$ exhibited an $I_H/I_F$ ratio greater than unity. In contrast, 32 out of 39 bursts originating from longitudes within $\pm75^\circ$ showed a intensity ratio less than unity. From these results, we conclude that the relative strength of the F and H emissions can be influenced by refraction due to density gradient in the solar corona, directivity and viewing angle of the bursts.

Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere.

The primary component has a mass of $1.4569_{-0.0100}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.543_{-0.009}^{+0.012}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6556_{-26}^{+64}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.18_{-0.01}^{+0.03}$ dex, while the secondary has a mass of $1.3579_{-0.0089}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.377_{-0.015}^{+0.013}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6468_{-21}^{+32}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.15_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ dex. The system is estimated to be $577_{-60}^{+60}$ Myr old with a synchronized orbit. The available O-C data imply a minimum mass of 0.57 $M_{\odot}$ or 0.11 $M_{\odot}$ for the third body, corresponding to eccentric and circular orbits, respectively. \texttt{MESA} evolutionary models indicate that the primary will fill its Roche lobe and begin mass transfer to the secondary in about 2.8 Gyr, whereas the secondary will reach the terminal-age main sequence in approximately 3.2 Gyr. The chemical composition of both stars shows remarkable consistency, confirming their common origin, except for calcium, which is significantly enhanced in the primary. Line measurements support this difference and are therefore interpreted as an intrinsic abundance variation rather than an artifact of the analysis. The overall solar-rich metallicity, combined with a relatively low $α$-element content, links V570\,Per to the Galactic thin-disk population. In addition, Galactic orbit analyses of open clusters in the solar neighborhood have revealed that the V570\,Per system may have originated from the Melotte 25 open cluster.

X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T_c \simeq 6\times10^8~\mathrm{K}$. This supports the pure-deflagration progenitor scenario for Type Iax SN 1181, which implies the presence of a He star companion inside Pa~30; we also discuss why such a potential He star has not been detected and its prospects for discovery by future observations.

We model the exoplanet populations around single stars, using planet occurrence rates and multiplicity depending on stellar mass, metallicity, and planet type, and assign them physical parameters such as mass and orbital period. Focussing first on the solar vicinity, we find mostly metallicity-driven differences in the distributions of non-hosting and planet-hosting single stars. In our simulated solar neighbourhood, 52.5% of all planets are Earth-like (23% of them located in the Habitable Zone), 44% are super-Earths/Neptunes, and 3.5% are giant planets. A comparison with the census of Kepler exoplanets and candidates shows that, when taking into account the most relevant selection effects, we obtain a similar distribution of exoplanets compared to the observed population. However, we also detect significant differences in the exoplanet and host star distributions (e.g. more planets around F-type and red-giant stars compared to observations) that we attribute mostly to a too strong recent star formation and a too large disc scale height in the simulation, as well as to some caveats in our exoplanet population synthesis that will be addressed in future work. Extending our analysis to other regions of the simulated MW and to other simulated galaxies, we find that the relative percentages of planet types remain largely consistent as long as the simulated galaxy matches the morphology and mass of the MW. We have created a fast and flexible framework to produce exoplanet populations based on MW-like simulations that can easily be adapted to produce predictions for the yields of future exoplanet detection missions.

We search for such stars inside the supernova remnants (SNRs), where a recent SN is guaranteed to have happened. In this paper, we present the massive runaway star HD~254577 as the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of the supernova remnant IC~443 and the neutron star (NS) CXOU~J61705.3$+$222127. We performed spectroscopic observations of the runaway star and specified its atmospheric parameters. Together with the precise \textit{Gaia} DR3 astrometry and photometry, we identified the possible birth origin of the runaway star, and by isochrone fitting, we determined the progenitor mass. From the \textit{Gaia} DR3 proper motions, we specified the possible explosion sites and calculated the neutron star (NS) velocity. HD~254577 is a hot and evolved star with an effective temperature of $24000\pm1000$ K (B0.5II) and a surface gravity of $\log({g~\rm[cm/s^2]})=2.75\pm0.25$. It is probably a single star with a peculiar 3-D velocity of $31.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ km~s$^{-1}$, lying at a heliocentric distance of $1701^{+55}_{-54}$ pc. The cometary tail of the NS implies that it is moving away from the same site as the runaway star. From the flight trajectories, we calculated that the NS has typical pulsar velocities such as $254-539$ km~s$^{-1}$ at a distance of $1.7$ kpc for $10-20$ kyr ages. Together with the blue-only shifted interstellar medium lines on its spectrum, HD~254577 must be the pre-supernova binary companion to the progenitor of IC~443. By identifying the pre-supernova companion and the possible parent cluster, we showed that the progenitor zero-age main sequence mass is high: $31-64$ M$_\odot$. We also discuss the expansion dynamics of the SNR due to the highly off-centered explosion site.

      , et al. (8 additional authors not shown)","Hot Jupiters are Jupiter-mass planets with orbital periods of less than ten days. Their short orbital separations make tidal dissipation within the stellar host especially efficient, potentially leading to a measurable evolution of the orbit. One possible manifestation of this is orbital decay, which presents itself observationally through variations in the orbital period and thus times of transit. Here we select four promising exoplanetary systems for detecting this effect: HIP 65, NGTS-6, NGTS-10 and WASP-173. We present 33 new transit light curves taken with the 1.54 m Danish Telescope, and analyse these alongside photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and transit timing data from the literature. We construct two ephemeris models for each target: a linear ephemeris and a shrinking orbital period due to tidal decay. The linear ephemeris is preferred for all four models - the highest significance for the quadratic ephemeris is 2 sigma for WASP-173. We compare these results to theoretical predictions for tidal dissipation of gravity waves in radiation zones, and find that wave breaking is predicted only in WASP-173, making rapid decay plausible in this system but unclear in the other three. The sensitivity of transit timings to orbital decay depends on the square of the time interval covered by available observations, so our results establish a useful baseline against which future measurements can be compared. NGTS-6 and NGTS-10 are important objects for future study as they are in the first field to be observed by the upcoming PLATO mission.

      Amit Kashi","We investigate the impact of the Bondi--Hoyle--Lyttleton (BHL) accretion mechanism on the evolution of nova eruptions in symbiotic systems by systematically varying three key input parameters: the initial donor (asymptotic giant branch; AGB) mass, the initial white dwarf (WD) mass, and the initial binary separation ($a$). We explore models with AGB masses in the range $1.5$--$3.5\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, WD masses in the range $0.7$--$1.25\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$, and separations in the range $1$--$8\,{\rm kR_{\odot}}$. We find that all models exhibit a significant long-term orbital increase. This trend is primarily driven by the fact that approximately $99\%$ of the AGB mass is lost from the system, either directly via a wind that is not accreted by the WD, or accreted onto the WD and subsequently ejected during nova eruptions. As a result, the secular orbital response to mass loss or mass transfer dominates over angular-momentum-loss sinks that could otherwise shrink the orbit, producing a consistent orbital widening. Consequently, all WD masses gradually decrease with time. More massive WDs achieve higher mass-transfer efficiencies and accretion rates, leading to slightly higher mass-retention efficiencies per nova. However, because higher accretion rates also produce more frequent eruptions, the total WD mass lost over the AGB lifetime is larger in these systems. We conclude that symbiotic systems transferring mass via the BHL mechanism are unlikely to be viable progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

We simulate the gravitational collapse of isolated, parsec-scale turbulent cores using the FLASH code, modelling stars as sink particles. Our simulations incorporate ionizing radiation and the associated radiation pressure from stellar sources, and non-ionizing radiation and its dust heating, along with self-consistent chemistry, to capture the properties of emerging ultra-compact HII regions. Dust, gas, and radiation temperature are computed independently. The initial conditions are informed by ALMAGAL observations. We assess stellar feedback, comparing ionizing radiation and radiation pressure. Ionizing radiation ultimately halts mass accretion on to sink particles, while direct radiation pressure enhances the expansion of HII regions. Heating from non-ionizing radiation suppresses fragmentation. We examine the effect of spatial resolution, finding that higher resolution leads to more sink particles which are situated in environments with higher densities. As a result, ionizing radiation remains trapped longer, allowing continued accretion and yielding a higher overall star formation efficiency (SFE). We explore the impact of varying initial conditions, including the core density profile, virial parameter, and metallicity. Our parameter study reveals that a flatter density profile, higher virial parameter, and increased metallicity promote fragmentation, potentially enhancing the SFE by slowing the growth of the most massive stars and delaying the onset of stellar feedback. Overall, we find SFEs between 35% and 57%. Stellar feedback dictates the final SFE.

The automated line identifications by PyEMILI demonstrate significant improvements in both completeness and accuracy compared to the previous manual identifications in the literature. Since our last report of PyEMILI, the atomic transition database used by the code has been further expanded by cross-matching the Kurucz Line Lists. Moreover, to aid the PyEMILI identification of numerous faint optical recombination lines (ORLs) of CII, NII, OII and NeII, we compiled a new dataset of effective recombination coefficients for these nebular lines, and created a new subroutine in the code to generate theoretical spectra of heavy-element ORLs at various electron temperature and density cases; these theoretical spectra can be used to fit the observed recombination spectrum of a PN to obtain the electron temperature, density and ionic abundances using the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We present MCMC-derived parameters for a sample of PNe. This work establishes PyEMILI as a robust and versatile tool for both line identification and plasma diagnostics in deep spectroscopy of gaseous nebulae.

"The Formation of Solar Prominences: Plasma Origin and Mechanisms","      
      Yuhao Zhou","Solar prominences, or solar filaments, are cool and dense plasma structures in the hot solar corona, whose formation mechanisms have remained a fundamental challenge in solar physics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current theoretical, numerical, and observational understanding of prominence formation, with a focus on the origin of the dense plasma component. We begin by summarizing the magnetic field configurations that enable prominence support, followed by a classification of four representative plasma formation mechanisms: injection, levitation, evaporation--condensation, and in-situ condensation. Each mechanism is analyzed in terms of its physical basis, numerical realizations, and observational diagnostics. A central focus is placed on the evaporation--condensation scenario, which has seen significant development over the past decade through numerical simulations. We also discuss recent progress in modeling in-situ condensation triggered by magnetic reconnection and levitation dynamics. Throughout, we emphasize the complementary nature of different mechanisms and their potential coexistence in forming and maintaining prominence mass. Observational constraints and recent high-resolution data are reviewed to assess the physical plausibility of each mechanism. We conclude by highlighting open questions and future directions in connecting multi-scale physical processes to the observed diversity of prominence behaviors.

In this work, we present an analysis of spectroscopic observations of V379 Vir obtained with the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The orbital variability of the H$α$ emission indicates that the line is most likely formed in the accretion stream near the Lagrangian point L$_1$, rather than on the donor's surface as previously assumed. The analysis of the rotational variability of the Zeeman splitting of hydrogen lines reveals a complex magnetic field topology of the white dwarf, which differs from a simple dipole configuration.

The He I spectra were inverted using the HAnle and ZEeman Light (HAZEL) code, showing an increase in optical depth towards the limb and a reversed convective blueshift for the red component, while the blue component was entirely absent. In addition, we find a strong increase in the steepness of the He I CLV compared to that of the nearby continuum. The Si I showed a behavior more typical of photospheric lines, namely shallower CLV, a reduction in width and depth, and a more typical convective blueshift.

These lines are detectable in metal-rich and, in contrast to atomic C lines, also in metal-poor late-type stars. However, only 3D LTE analyses of the CH lines have been performed so far.
  Aims. We test the formation of CH lines in the solar spectrum, using for the first time, 3D Non-LTE (NLTE) models. We also aim to derive the solar photospheric abundance of C, using the diagnostic transitions in the optical (4218 - 4356 Å) and infrared (33025 - 37944 Å).
  Methods. We use the updated NLTE model molecule from Popa et al. (2023) and different solar 3D radiation-hydrodynamics model atmospheres. The models are contrasted against new spatially-resolved optical solar spectra, and the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of CH lines is studied.
  Results. The 1D LTE and 1D NLTE models fail to describe the line CLV, and lead to underestimated solar C abundances. The 3D NLTE modelling of diagnostic lines in the optical and IR yields a carbon abundance of A(C)=$8.52\pm0.07$ dex. The estimate is in agreement with recent results based on neutrino fluxes measured by Borexino.
  Conclusions. 3D NLTE modelling and tests on spatially-resolved solar data are essential to derive robust solar abundances. The analysis presented here focuses on CH, but we expect that similar effects will be present for other molecules of astrophysical interest.

The first class contains the Alfvén waves. The Alfvén waves are incompressible and propagate parallel vorticity. They do not have a parallel component of displacement, they do not cause variations in pressure and are driven by magnetic tension only. The second class contains the magneto-sonic waves. They are compressible and have a parallel component of displacement. They do not propagate parallel vorticity and are driven by pressure and magnetic tension. In non-uniform plasmas the situation can be very different. The clear division between Alfvén waves and magneto-sonic waves is no longer present. In a given part of the equilibrium an MHD wave can strongly resemble a magneto-sonic wave with little or no resemblance to Alfvén waves; while in another part of the equilibrium the MHD wave is practically an Alfvén wave, which has the amazing property of being accompanied by variations in pressure.

This passage marks the first to be observed with modern, state-of-the-art instruments. We investigate the inner, sub-arcsecond active region of R Aqr during this recent periastron passage, with the goal of gaining insight into the jet-launching mechanisms at work in this system. We analyse Ha speckle interferometric images obtained one month apart using Fourier techniques. These are complemented by high-resolution optical spectra in the same emission line. Our speckle imaging reveals a newborn two-sided jet orientated in the north-south direction. Its proper motion, 66 +- 19 mas per year, confirms that it was launched around 2020 Jan 7, at the onset of the periastron passage. Further analysis of the elongated central structure reveals a knot in the southern counterpart of the jet, moving away from the binary with a 27 +- 17 mas per year at a position angle of 187 degrees, and an ejection time around 2019 Oct 28. This interpretation is further supported by our high-resolution spectroscopic data. In addition, we update the expansion parallax distance of R Aqr to 260 pc.

      , et al. (4 additional authors not shown)","We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$~mag~(100\,d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN~2016iog one of the fastest declining Type~IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$α$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$α$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN~2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN~2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.

We aim to obtain an accurate reconstruction of the surface spot distribution on the young, rapidly rotating K2 star PW And by combining spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. In particular, we seek to assess how the inclusion of continuous high-precision TESS photometry in parallel with high-resolution spectroscopy improves latitude recovery of starspots, especially at low latitudes and in the southern hemisphere, which are poorly constrained by Doppler imaging (DI) alone. We explore the spatial origins of the observed white-light flares. We performed simultaneous Doppler imaging and light curve inversion (DI+LCI) using contemporaneous high-resolution GAOES-RV spectra from the 3.8 m Seimei telescope (R~65000) and high-precision TESS light curves. Surface reconstructions employ the SpotDIPy code to model both line profiles and continuum brightness variations. We compare DI+LCI maps with DI-only solutions, conduct artificial-spot simulations to evaluate the effects of latitude, phase coverage, and S/N on reconstruction reliability. We also investigate the spatial correlation between the DI+LCI reconstructed map and flares detected in the TESS data. The DI+LCI reconstruction reveals significant spot features at mid-to-low latitudes, equatorial regions, and even in the southern hemisphere. Simulations show that DI+LCI provides more accurate reconstructions than DI-only, especially under conditions of incomplete phase coverage and low S/N, by better recovering both spot latitudes and filling factors. A comparison between the DI+LCI map and the TESS flare timings also suggests potential association between flare occurrence and reconstructed spot longitudes.

We conducted a standard periodicity search on these data as well as a single pulse search at a range of dispersion measures. We found no convincing candidate signals, and we calculate flux density, luminosity, and single pulse fluence limits from these observations. The derived luminosity limits are comparable to the luminosities of three young, energetic pulsars (the Crab pulsar, PSR B0540$-$69, and PSR J0537$-$6910), and so we cannot rule out the existence of a pulsar in SNR 1987A with a similar radio luminosity.

      Xuefei Chen","Helium white dwarfs (WDs) with masses less than 0.3 $\rm M_{\sun}$ are known as extremely low-mass WDs (ELM WDs), which cannot be produced by single stellar evolution in theory. Generally, these stars are believed to form through binary interactions. Recently, two ELM WDs in unusually wide orbits were reported, i.e., KIC 8145411 and HE 0430-2457. Their orbital separations are too wide to be produced by the binary evolution scenario. In this work, we study the formation of wide-orbit ELM WD binaries from hierarchical triple systems. In this scenario, an ELM WD is formed from the inner binary and subsequently forms a wide binary system with the third object. We find that the merger of an evolved star with a brown dwarf in the inner binary fails to produce single ELM WDs, but Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) explosions can successfully do so. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the supernova explosion on the orbital distribution of the surviving binary and find that this channel may have a probability of reproducing the orbital parameters of HE 0430-2457, but fails to reproduce the observed features of KIC 8145411. This supports recent observational recalibrations suggesting that KIC 8145411 resides in a triple system rather than a binary.

"Solar Filament Physiognomy: Inferring Magnetic Quantities from Imaging Observations","      
      P. F. Chen","Magnetic field is the key physical quantity in solar physics as it controls all kinds of solar activity, ranging from nanoflares to big flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, so far only the magnetic field on the solar surface can be more or less precisely measured, and the most important coronal magnetic field remains undetectable accurately. Without the knowledge of the coronal magnetic field, it is even more difficult to obtain secondary quantities related to magnetic field, such as the magnetic helicity and magnetic configuration, including the curvature of field lines. The prevailing approaches to obtain the coronal magnetic field include coronal magnetic extrapolation and coronal seismology. Actually there were scattered efforts to derive secondary magnetic quantities based on imaging observations of solar filaments, without the help of polarization measurements. We call this approach solar filament physiognomy. In this paper, we review these efforts made in the past decades, and point out that this approach will be promising as large telescopes are being built and more fine structures of filament channels will be revealed.

We explored the variability of the dominant molecular bands present in their 0.6--5.3~$μ$m spectra (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO), finding that the B component exhibits a higher maximum deviation than the A component in all the wavelength ranges tested. The light curves reveal wavelength-(atmospheric depth) and possibly chemistry-dependent variability. In particular, for the A component, the variability in the light curves at the wavelengths traced by the CH$_4$ and CO molecular absorption features is higher than that of H$_2$O, even when both trace similar pressure levels. We concluded that clouds alone are unlikely to explain the increased variability of CO and CH$_4$ with respect to H$_2$O, suggesting that an additional physical mechanism is needed to explain the observed variability. This mechanism is probably due to thermochemical instabilities. Finally, we provide a visual representation of the 3D atmospheric map reconstructed for both components using the molecular band contributions at different pressure levels and the fit of planetary-scale waves.

The first observation of the turbulence propagator in space emerges through analysis of more than a thousand intervals. Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides unprecedented insight into the space-time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.

Our systematic echelle spectroscopy, secured since September 2021, led to the discovery that the optical spectra are dominated by spectral lines of three early-type stars, two moving around each other on a 8.234 d orbit of a high eccentricity, which causes periodic brightenings near the periastron passage, and the third one (component Ba) being the brighter component of the 5.853 d binary. Both pairs are physically bounded and revolve around each other with a period somewhere between 1600 and 2200 days (4.4 to 6 years). The object exhibits small cyclic light variations of a variable amplitude and characteristic time scale of 0.071 d (14.14 c d-1), seen throughout the whole orbit. The nature of these tiny changes deserves further investigation. It also seems that the earlier classification of the object as a Be star is unfounded.

"Using Light Curve Derivatives to Estimate the Fill-out Factor of Overcontact Binaries","      
      Shinjirou Kouzuma","We propose a simple method for estimating the fill-out factor of overcontact binary systems using the derivatives of light curves. We synthesized 74,431 sample light curves, covering the typical parameter space of overcontact binaries. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. Among the classified types, for systems exhibiting high mass ratios and high inclinations (i.e., SPf type), we found that the fill-out factor has a strong correlation with the time interval between two local extrema in the third derivatives of their light curves. An empirical formula to estimate the fill-out factor was derived using regression analysis for the identified correlation. Application to real overcontact binary data demonstrated that the proposed method is practical for obtaining reliable estimates of the fill-out factor and its associated uncertainties.

Wavelengths for 10426 spectral lines were extracted from the FT spectra, with uncertainties at least an order-of-magnitude lower than previous measurements. Wavelengths for 13397 lines from new grating spectra were determined for spectral regions beyond the FT spectra range or to provide wavelengths for weak transitions not observed in FT spectra. To aid in level identification, selected, previously published grating lines were included in the energy level optimisation, but no levels in this work relied solely on previously published wavelengths. In total, 24237 lines were included in the final spectral linelist, and these were used to identify 2186 Mn I transitions. These classified spectral lines were then used to optimise the values of 384 previously published energy levels of Mn I, with typical uncertainties of a few 10-3 cm-1, again typically an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. Our study then expanded the known energy level structure of Mn I through the establishment of 18 new energy levels, reported here for the first time. In total, 2187 lines and 402 energy levels of Mn I have been determined as a result of our work, marking a substantial advance in the precision of Mn I atomic data which will enable far more accurate analyses of Mn I lines in astrophysical spectra.
  Please note: The final wavelength and energy level datasets are withheld from this pre-print to ensure that only the peer-reviewed, definitive versions are released.

They are trains of advected density structures with radial length scales LR in the 100-10,000 Mm range, thus belonging to the class of solar wind mesoscale structures. Even though PDS at L1 have been extensively studied both through statistical and event analysis, their investigation at distances closer to the Sun is limited. This study performs a statistical investigation of PDS at various distances from the Sun between 0.3 and 1 AU by exploiting Solar Orbiter data. We compiled and made publicly available an extensive list of PDSs following a well-established methodology that combines the Multitaper method as well as wavelet analysis to reveal the distribution of PDS radial length scales and how they vary with respect to the radial distance. Our results indicate that PDS advected with the ambient slow solar wind are expanded at a rate of approximately 10%, while PDS detected during fast solar wind segments show compression at a similar rate. These are consistent with the scenario in which PDSs are formed at the Sun by processes involving magnetic reconnection and interchange reconnection in the solar corona.

We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the present-day mass of the donor star represents its initial convective core mass at Zero-Age Main Sequence, we estimate its initial mass using detailed stellar evolution models. From the initial donor mass, we calculate the range of initial accretor masses (for different mass transfer efficiencies). By imposing physical constraints on the above initial parameter ranges, we derive the mass transfer efficiency, stability and angular momentum loss that can reproduce the current properties of each Algol binary. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\sim$28\,\% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\lesssim$\,50\,\%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\%. The current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods (2\,d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\sim 0.6$. The massive Algols in the SMC seem to have undergone less efficient mass transfer than those in the LMC and Milky Way. (Abridged)

A previous study of HH 111 VLA1 suggested a decrease in rotation velocity in a region between the infalling envelope and rotating disk. Using ALMA C$^{18}$O ($J = 2-1$) data, we analyzed the gas motion within 6000 au and found clear deviations from the simplest expectations of free-fall towards the central star with conserved angular momentum in the transition region between the envelope and disk (from $\sim$5200 to 160 au). The region can be further divided into three zones: (1) outer region with a significant decrease in infall velocity, dropping to approximately 60\% of the free-fall velocity and 70\% of conservation of angular momentum and energy; (2) middle region with a sharp drop in angular momentum and thus rotation velocity and an increase in infall velocity; and (3) inner region with rotation velocity increasing inward to connect to that of the Keplerian disk and infall velocity decreasing to zero. Comparison with non-ideal MHD simulations suggests that the reduced infall velocity in the outer region can be due to magnetic tension by the pinched magnetic field lines, the sharp drop of angular momentum in the middle region can be due to magnetic braking as the field lines pile up, and the rapid increase in rotation velocity in the inner region might result from weaker magnetic braking due to ambipolar diffusion of the field lines. The resulting dip in the rotation profile supports magnetic braking.

  Aims. We investigate how mass accretion and donation in close binaries affects the internal structure and oscillation modes of main-sequence stars.
  Methods. Building on the established relation between the Brunt-Vaisala (buoyancy) glitch and the Fourier spectra of g-mode period spacings, we quantitatively explain the origins of the g-mode period-spacing differences between single-star and mass-accretion/donation models of intermediate-mass stars (M = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 Msun). In particular, the hydrogen mass fraction profiles X of the donor model show two chemical gradient regions, which results in a double-peaked Brunt-Vaisala profile. The presence of additional buoyancy glitches gives rise to further periodic modulations in the g-mode period spacings.
  Results. Mass-accretion induced changes in the chemical profile create sharp features in the buoyancy frequency, which modify both the amplitudes and frequencies of the g-mode period-spacing variations. This behavior resembles that produced by multiple chemical transition zones in compact pulsators such as white dwarfs and sub-dwarf B stars. Similarly, for acoustic modes in the M = 1 Msun solar-like models, we attribute the differences in frequency-separation ratios between single-star and mass-donor models to the variations in the internal sound-speed gradient (acoustic glitches). We discuss future prospects for using asteroseismology to discover the mass-transfer products and constrain the mass-transfer processes in binary star evolution.

      Jason Dittmann","M dwarfs are magnetically active stars that frequently produce flares, which have implications for both stellar evolution and exoplanet studies. Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period. We search TESS observations of a known active population of M dwarfs as well as a volume-limited sample of M dwarfs within 15 parsecs. We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($α$) across activity levels. We find $α=1.99 \pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $α= 1.94 \pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $α= 2.03 \pm 0.43$ for those with > 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $α$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra.

      Hideyuki Saio","The rising phase toward the optical maximum of a classical nova is one of the last frontiers of nova study. Constructing free-free emission model light curves based on our fully self-consistent nova explosion models, we present several theoretical light curves of classical novae and compare them with the four novae having the observed rising phase toward the optical maximum. Our 1.25 $M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) models show excellent agreements with the light curves of KT Eri, V339 Del, and V597 Pup while our 1.35 $M_\odot$ WD models are consistent with the light curves of SMC NOVA 2016-10a. These agreements indicate that the light curves toward the optical maximum of these novae are dominated by free-free emission, rather than by photospheric emission. Our results justify the previously obtained WD masses and distance moduli for these novae, and shows that the post-maximum evolution can be well approximated with the evolution sequences of steady-state envelope solutions.

      A. G. Grunfeld","We investigate self-bound quark stars in a flavor-dependent quark-mass density-dependent (QMDD) model with an excluded-volume correction. We chart the parameter space at zero pressure to identify self-bound regimes, including cases with a first-order $ud \to uds$ transition, and construct cold, $β$-equilibrated stellar sequences via the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. The excluded-volume parameter $κ$ controls the stiffness of the equation of state and thus masses, radii, tidal deformabilities, and moments of inertia. Intermediate repulsion typically reconciles $M_{\max} \gtrsim 2\,M_\odot$ with current radius/tidal constraints, with hybrid self-bound objects more compatible than pure strange-quark stars. We identify three EOS-insensitive trends $-$ dimensionless moment of inertia vs. compactness, tidal deformability vs. compactness, and gravitational vs. baryonic compactness $-$ whose explicit $κ$-dependence largely disappears in dimensionless form (the first two being notably tighter than the third). These results provide model-guided priors and tools for discriminating between hadronic and self-bound EOS families with multimessenger data.

      Yifan Zhou","The L/T transition is a critical evolutionary stage for brown dwarfs and self-luminous giant planets. L/T transition brown dwarfs are more likely to be spectroscopically variable, and their high-amplitude variability probes distributions in their clouds and chemical makeup. This paper presents Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 spectral time series data for three variable L/T transition brown dwarfs and compares the findings to the highly variable benchmark object 2MASS J2139. All four targets reveal significant brightness variability between 1.1 to 1.65 micron but show a difference in wavelength dependence of the variability amplitude. Three of our targets do not show significant decrease in variability amplitude in the 1.4 $μ$m water absorption band commonly found in previous studies of L/T transition brown dwarfs. Additionally, at least two brown dwarfs have irregular-shaped, non-sinusoidal light curves. We create heterogeneous atmospheric models by linearly combining SONORA Diamondback model spectra, comparing them with the observations, and identifying the optimal effective temperature, cloud opacity, and cloud coverage for each object. Comparisons between the observed and model color-magnitude variations that trace both spectral windows and molecular features reveal that the early- T dwarfs likely possess heterogeneous clouds. The three T dwarfs show different trends in the same color-magnitude space which suggests secondary mechanisms driving their spectral variability. This work broadens the sample of L/T transition brown dwarfs that have detailed spectral time series analysis and offers new insights that can guide future atmospheric modeling efforts for both brown dwarfs and exoplanets.

"Solar Cycle 25 Dynamics from Observational and Statistical Parameters: Characterization of the Maximum Phase and Rotational Behaviour","      
      Homer Dávila Gutiérrez","We present a comprehensive analysis of Solar Cycle 25 aimed at precisely constraining the interval of its activity maximum using multiple observational parameters: sunspot number (SSN), Wolf number, the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (F10.7), the occurrence rate and speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), the statistics of X-ray flares, and the reversal of the global magnetic field. A percentile-based classification of the adjusted F10.7 flux (EPH scale) is introduced, which allows us to identify the maximum-activity interval as August 2024 to January 2025. This period coincides with the reversal of the solar polar fields and is characterized by enhanced eruptive activity, including more than 190 M-class and 19 X-class flares (including an X6.3 flare on 10 December 2024) and multiple CMEs with speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. In the second part of the study we investigate solar rotation during this cycle using an independent observing campaign conducted in April 2025 in San Jose, Costa Rica, with privately owned telescopes in white light and in the H alpha line. Photometric techniques and active-region tracking yield mean synodic angular velocities of 12.8 +/- 2.8 deg/day in the northern hemisphere and 13.38 +/- 0.54 deg/day in the southern hemisphere, corresponding to sidereal periods of 22.78 and 21.77 days, respectively. Complementary SWPC-NOAA sunspot-region data provide synodic periods between 21.19 and 25.74 days, consistent with classical differential-rotation measurements. Linear velocities derived from SDO images span from about 872 km/h to more than 7400 km/h, depending on latitude and date.

In this paper we present spectroscopic and photometric results of 15 transient sources pre-classified as AM CVn candidates. Our analysis confirms 9 systems of the type AM CVn, 3 hydrogen-rich cataclysmic variables (accreting white dwarfs with near-main-sequence stars for donors) and 3 systems that could be evolved cataclysmic variables. Eight of the AM CVn stars are analysed spectroscopically for the first time, which increases the number of spectroscopically confirmed AM CVns by about $10\%$. TESS data revealed the orbital period of the AM CVn star ASASSN-20pv to be $P_\mathrm{orb}=27.282\,\mathrm{min}$, which helps to constrain the possible values of its mass ratio. TESS also helped to determine the superhump periods of one AM CVn star (ASASSN-19ct, $P_\mathrm{sh}=30.94\,\mathrm{min}$) and two cataclysmic variables we classify as WZ Sge stars ($P_\mathrm{sh}=90.77\,\mathrm{min}$ for ZTF18aaaasnn and $P_\mathrm{sh}=91.6\,\mathrm{min}$ for ASASSN-15na). We identified very different abundances in the spectra of the AM CVns binaries ASASSN-15kf and ASASSN-20pv (both $P_\mathrm{orb}\sim 27.5$ min), suggesting different type of donors. Six of the studied AM CVns are X-ray sources, which helped to determine their mass accretion rates. Photometry shows that the duration of all the superoutbursts detected in the AM CVns is consistent with expectations from the disc instability model. Finally, we provide refined criteria for the identification of new systems using all-sky surveys such as LSST.

      W. LF. Marcolino, 
      
      V. Maria","The radiation field of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) is crucial for determining the physical conditions of planetary nebulae (PNe). Many studies in the literature model PNe using the blackbody approximation (bb) or plane-parallel (p-p) atmospheres as the ionizing source. However, these approaches become inconsistent when the central star is a Wolf-Rayet ([WR]) type. These objects are hydrogen-deficient and exhibit intense stellar winds, similar to classical massive WR stars. Their accurate description therefore requires sophisticated NLTE expanding atmosphere models. In this work, we selected [WR] NLTE expanding-atmosphere models spanning a range of temperatures and mass-loss rates and compared them with bb and p-p models. We examined differences in the spectral energy distribution and ionizing photon fluxes for H I, He I, and He II to assess the impact of stellar winds on the nebula-star interaction. Using CLOUDY, we also evaluated how each ionizing source affects predicted line ratios (I$_λ$/I$_β$) for a sample of PNe with [WR] nuclei. Model performance was measured through the rms deviation between observed and predicted ratios. For temperatures below 100,000 K, the EUV spectrum differs strongly among the three model types. Stellar winds introduce substantial opacity, reducing log Q(He II) significantly relative to no-wind models. For hotter [WR] stars, wind effects on ionizing fluxes are much smaller. For nebulae hosting late-type [WR] stars, models including winds provide much better agreement with observed line ratios than bb or p-p models, whereas for early-type stars the choice of ionizing source has only a minor influence. Our results indicate that bb and p-p approximations should be avoided when modelling PNe with [WR] central stars, especially those of the [WCL] subtype, because they fail to reproduce the strong wind-modified ionizing spectra.

Recent studies show that binary evolution and non-solar abundance patterns are required to explain the distinct spectra of high-z galaxies observed by JWST. However, treatments of these properties vary drastically between models. We present the first results from a comparison of models with different treatments of binaries, including BPASS and novel stripped star models, with rest-UV-optical spectra of high-z galaxies' local analogs. This type of investigation can provide insights into which aspects of binary evolution are important to reproduce observations and identify priorities in ongoing efforts to improve models. By constraining the properties of massive stars at high redshift, we can learn about the processes at play in high-z galaxies and massive star evolution more broadly.

We measure CO emission sizes for 37 disks with bright CO J=3-2 emission (S/N > 10 on the integrated flux; out of the 83 disks with CO detections), finding that the median radius containing 90% of the flux is ~84 au, with radii spanning from 23 up to 243 au. We report a correlation between the 12CO brightness temperatures and stellar luminosities, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6, and we use it to prove that the 12CO optically thick emission layer primarily emanates from a region below the super-heated dust, which is optically thin to the stellar irradiation. Moreover, we derive 33 CO emission surface height profiles, finding a median aspect ratio <z/r> ~ 0.16 in a range from ~0.01 up to ~0.45 over the sample. Finally, we comment on the multiple systems in our sample, of which only some were already known. These results re-affirm how it is possible to derive bulk disk properties by modeling moderate angular resolution ALMA visibilities.

      Jim Fuller","Thermal convection in rotating stars and planets drives anisotropic turbulence and strong differential rotation, both capable of feeding energy into global oscillations. Using 3D simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells, we show that inertial modes--oscillations restored by the Coriolis force--emerge naturally in rotationally constrained turbulence, without imposing any external forcing. By varying the rotation rate at fixed thermal forcing, we find that coherent modes appear only when the convective Rossby number, the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time, falls below about one-half, where rotation dominates the dynamics. These modes are mostly retrograde in the rotating frame, equatorially symmetric, and confined to mid and high latitudes, with discrete frequencies well below twice the rotation rate. At lower viscosities, or smaller Prandtl number, mode excitation becomes more efficient and a broader spectrum of inertial modes emerges. While the precise excitation mechanism remains uncertain, our results suggest that the modes are driven by shear instabilities rather than stochastic forcing by convection. We conclude that similar inertial modes are likely to exist in the interiors of giant planets and stars, though their low frequencies will make them difficult to detect.

We then modeled the large-scale and small-scale magnetic properties of TWA 7 using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. We found that TWA 7 hosted a mainly poloidal field that significantly evolved from 2019 to 2021, the dipole component getting stronger (increasing from 0.5 kG in 2019 to 0.7 kG in 2021) and less inclined to the stellar rotation axis (from 22° in 2019 to 15° in 2021). We also analyzed the radial velocities of TWA 7 derived from the SPIRou data, and found a tentative planet signature at a period of 15.2 d (with aliases at 20.8 and 30.4 d), very close to the detection limit of our data and that would correspond to a 0.17 Mjup planet at a distance of 0.09 au if confirmed. We finally report modulation of the 1083 nm He I and 1282 nm Pa-beta lines of TWA 7 with a period of 6.6 d, different from the rotation period and potentially hinting at the presence of a close-in planet triggering star-planet interactions.

The nova light and the counterpart coincide to 0.034 arc-seconds, and the counterpart is a rare hot/blue emission-line star with flickering, so the identification of the quiescent nova is certain. The counterpart is a weak Be main sequence star, B1 V(n)(e). A coherent photometric period appears in all four {\it TESS} Sectors and in the AAVSO post-eruption light curve, as ellipsoidal modulation with orbital period 2.041738 days. The companion must have been spun-up to a fast rotation, and like all Be stars, a decretion disk is exuded. With the constraints of the blackbody radius and the main sequence, the companion mass is 13.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$, with radius 6.2$\pm$0.2 $R_{\odot}$. This is the discovery of a cataclysmic variable with a high-mass companion, a new class that we call `High Mass Cataclysmic Variables'. The white dwarf mass is 1.25$\pm$0.10 $M_{\odot}$ and must have an accretion disk that supplies fuel for the nova eruption. FQ Cir represents a new mode of accretion in interacting binaries, with Roche lobe overflow from the decretion disk feeding mass into the usual accretion disk around the white dwarf, for disk-to-disk accretion. From the mass budget of the binary, the primary star must have its initial mass $>$7.6 $M_{\odot}$, forming an ONe white dwarf, so FQ Cir can never become a Type Ia supernova.

We confirm that LL Aqr displays low stellar activity by obtaining $2σ$ upper limits on the mean surface magnetic field strengths of 78 G and 96 G. Our results suggest an age of 2.67 - 3.01 Gyr, which is consistent with previous studies.

      Núria Miret-Roig","Over the past 25 years, observations have uncovered a large population of free-floating planets (FFPs), whose origins remain debated. Massive FFPs (several Jupiter masses or more) may form via gravitational collapse of molecular clouds, similar to stars. Lower-mass FFPs likely originate in planetary systems and are later ejected through dynamical interactions. We show that disc fragmentation in very young stellar binaries may be an abundant source of Jupiter-like FFPs (JFFPs), with masses above 0.3 Jupiter masses. In our model, disc fragmentation at tens to 100 au from the primary star produces gas giants, while fragmentation further out forms a more massive object that will eventually evolve into the secondary star. We present 3D simulations of massive, self-gravitating discs with embedded Jupiter-mass planets and a secondary seed ($5-50 M_J$). Chaotic migration leads to frequent planet-secondary interactions, imparting velocity kicks via gravitational slingshot that usually end in planet ejection. The ejection fraction increases steeply with the secondary-to-primary mass ratio, $q_s$, reaching 0.6 for $q_s > 0.05$. Compared to Core Accretion JFFPs, disc fragmentation JFFPs: (i) form earlier, and may be more abundant in young clusters; (ii) are ejected at much lower velocities; (iii) may retain compact circum-planetary discs. To reproduce the observed abundance of JFFPs, disc fragmentation planets must be in the post-collapse configuration. They must also either form more frequently in binary systems than around single stars, or be frequently disrupted in inner disc regions, as previously suggested in certain versions of the theory.

However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $Δ_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.

      Fernando Frias","In recent years, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) have emerged as promising platforms for optical interferometry through the use of intensity interferometry. IACTs combine large segmented mirrors, photodetectors with nanosecond-scale time response capable of detecting signals from just a few photo-electrons, and array configurations with baselines of hundreds of meters. As a result, all major IACT facilities have now been upgraded to function also as optical intensity interferometers, achieving sensitivities an order of magnitude better than their predecessor, the Narrabri Stellar Intensity Interferometer. However, further improvements in sensitivity are currently limited by key IACT design constraints, namely the combination of poor optical quality and small focal ratios. Here we present three practical implementations of the ""I3T concept"", in which segments of the IACT primary mirror are focused onto different pixels of its camera. This approach yields several unexpected but significant advantages. Optics with larger focal ratios allow to integrate narrow-band optical filters, while lower photon fluxes enable to deploy next-generation photodetectors operating in photon-counting mode. We demonstrate that this so-called ""Butterfly's Eye"" configuration enhances the sensitivity of IACT-based intensity interferometers by a factor between 4 and 6. Moreover, as originally envisioned, the I3T design introduces imaging capabilities on angular scales from 2 to 40 milliarcseconds, unlocking new scientific opportunities such as direct surface imaging of nearby red giants. Besides, realistic simulations show that it can have a transformative impact on at least two key science cases: imaging the earliest stages of nova ejecta, and measuring the oblateness and circumstellar disks of fast-rotating stars.

      Rik T. Luisman","Recent low-frequency array (LOFAR) radio signal detections bearing from the $τ$ Boötis system have been cautiously attributed to auroral emissions from the hot Jupiter $τ$ Boötis Ab. The auroral emissions are believed to be excited by interaction between the exoplanet and the winds of its host star. Since stellar winds respond to stellar surface magnetism, three-dimensional stellar wind modelling, able to account for the star's contemporaneous magnetic field geometry, can aid the interpretation of radio detections. For the first time, we present spectropolarimetric observations of $τ$ Boötis A from the same epoch as the LOFAR detections. We derive a contemporaneous large-scale magnetic map of $τ$ Boötis A, which shows a poloidally dominated field with mean strength 1.6 G. From our magnetic map, we create a three-dimensional numerical wind model and characterise the wind properties around $τ$ Boötis Ab. To compute the wind power dissipated in $τ$ Boötis Ab's magnetosphere, we apply two approaches: A) the solar system-based empirical relation called Bode's law; and B) a resolved numerical model of the planetary magnetosphere. When consistently applying best-case assumptions, we redict radio flux densities around 50 mJy and 0.68 mJy respectively. Our values are much too small to be consistent with the reported observation of $890_{-500}^{+690}$ mJy; a stellar surface magnetic field scaling $\gtrsim 10$ is required to reproduce the observed signal strength. As $τ$ Boötis A has a rapid magnetic cycle, we speculate that wind variations cased by variation in stellar magnetism may explain the lack of detections from follow-up observations. Our work emphasises the importance of contemporaneous observations of stellar magnetism and observational signatures of star-planet interaction.

At low metallicities (Z), WN3-type WR stars have relatively thin winds and are major sources of ionizing flux. The detection of high-ionization emission lines in high-redshift ($z$) galaxies as well as nearby low-Z dwarf galaxies raises questions about the origin of He II ionizing radiation and its role in galaxy evolution, as stellar population models fail to reproduce the required fluxes. Low-Z WN3 stars may provide the missing contribution but are easily hidden in integrated light. Using the Local Volume Mapper, we compare resolved optical spectra of SMC WN3 stars with integrated regions, focusing on the broad He II $\lambda4686\,Å$ line. We find stellar emission diluted within nebular regions, becoming undetectable when integrating over areas larger than 24 pc. Nonetheless, these stars emit enough ionizing photons to explain observed He II nebular emission, being strong candidates for the He II ionizing sources in low-Z and high-$z$ galaxies.

"Thermal equilibrium curves of accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability","      
      Shigenobu Hirose","Analogous to the HR diagram for stars, the thermal equilibrium curve encodes the thermodynamics of accretion disks by expressing the local balance between heating -- primarily via viscous dissipation -- and cooling -- typically through radiative transfer. These curves are commonly plotted as surface density versus effective temperature. When an S-shaped locus appears, local annuli become bistable, and limit-cycle oscillations arise when the external mass-transfer rate falls within an unstable band. This behavior underpins the disk instability model for recurring outbursts in cataclysmic variables. This paper reviews first-principles thermal equilibrium curves for accretion disks driven by magnetorotational instability (MRI), with emphasis on dwarf novae. Unlike the parameterized $α$-viscosity approach, the curves are obtained by solving the governing equations with radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations, thereby reproducing S-shaped loci without prescribing $α$. The disk instability in dwarf-nova systems and the physical origin of angular-momentum transport (shear stresses) are also briefly reviewed. Notes on the stability of radiation-dominated accretion flows are included in the Appendix.

Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion. Within the Herglotz variational approach, the linear $f(R,T)=R+αT$ model, previously ruled out in the standard formulation due to its fixed deceleration parameter, becomes consistent with observations.

Although iron depletion is observed in the interstellar medium (ISM), the exact form and fraction of iron in solid remains under debate. In particular, it is unclear whether amorphous silicate dust around AGB stars contains metallic iron. We aimed to provide optical constants of amorphous silicate nanoparticles and examine the effects of metallic iron on their spectral features to better constrain the dust properties by producing amorphous silicate nanoparticles with and without metallic cores. We performed condensation experiments using an induction thermal plasma system to produce dust analogues of the CI chondritic composition in the Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-Fe-Ni-O and Mg-Ca-Na-Al-Si-O systems. We measured the absorbance and reflectance of the samples, observed the structure of the products, and determined the optical constants. Two types of amorphous silicate nanoparticles (10-200 nm in diameter) with nearly CI chondritic composition were produced: one contained kamacite (Fe: Ni=0.9: 0.1) cores with a diameter ratio ranging 0-0.87 (average ~0.50), and the other was iron-free homogeneous amorphous silicate. The amorphous silicates of the CI chondritic composition with various sized metallic cores may be prevalent in circumstellar and interstellar dust.

These pulsating variable stars, found primarily in older stellar populations, exhibit well-defined period-luminosity relations but with an added advantage that they exhibit weak or negligible dependence on metallicity. We explore their relevance in the context of their role as distance indicators and potential calibrators of the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder.

      Arkaprabha Sarangi","We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.

"Measuring Cometary Nuclei Behind Bright Comae: PSF Delta Decomposition with Bicubic Resampling and an Application to Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS C/2025 N1","      
      Toni Scarmato","Measuring cometary nuclei is notoriously difficult because they are usually unresolved and embedded within bright comae, which hampers direct size measurements even with space telescopes. We present a practical, instrumental method that, stabilises the inner core through bicubic resampling, performs forward point-spread function PSF+convolution, and separates the unresolved nucleus from the inner-coma profile via an explicit Dirac Delta function added to a Rho^-1 surface brightness law. The method yields the nucleus flux by fitting an azimuthal averaged profile with two amplitudes only PSF core and convolved coma, with transparent residual diagnostics. As a case study, we apply the workflow to the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS alias C/2025 N1, incorporating Hubble Space Telescope constraints on the nucleus size. We find that radius solutions consistent with 0.16 <= Rn <= 2.8 km for Pv = 0.04 are naturally recovered, in line with the most recent HST upper limits. The approach is well-suited for survey pipelines Rubin LSST and targeted follow up.

These structures not only suggest the presence of such planets, but also act as potential noise sources in future mid-infrared (MIR) nulling interferometry observations. We aim to investigate how resonant structures in exozodiacal dust vary across stellar spectral types (F4--M4), and to evaluate how stellar wind drag affects their morphology and brightness in mature planetary systems. We conducted numerical simulations of dust dynamics, extending earlier studies by including spectral type variation in stellar wind drag in addition to Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag. Our models represented systems of a few Gyr hosting an Earth-like exoplanet in the habitable zone (HZ). We produced spatially resolved maps of optical depth and thermal emission for different stellar spectral types. Our simulations showed that resonant ring structures were formed for all stellar spectral types considered. In particular, we found that stellar wind drag played a critical role in shaping dust dynamics around old M-type stars, where it could dominate over PR drag by a factor of approximately 44. This reduced the contrast of resonant rings relative to the background disk, compared to cases without spectral type variation in stellar wind. Across different spectral types, the optical depth contrast of the resonant ring increased for lower-mass stars, assuming a fixed background level. Asymmetric thermal emission distributions were derived across all spectral types, which peaked for K-type stars. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating both resonant dynamics and stellar wind effects when modeling exozodiacal dust around stars of different spectral types.

The spectral analysis led to the triple-lined radial velocities and the atmospheric parameters of the eclipsing components. Joint modeling of these observations reveals that the eclipsing pair contains two F-type stars with masses $1.564\pm0.012$ $M_\odot$ and $1.483\pm0.012$ $M_\odot$, radii $1.588\pm0.011$ $R_\odot$ and $1.500\pm0.012$ $R_\odot$, effective temperatures $7028\pm100$ K and $7020\pm110$ K, and luminosities $5.51\pm0.32$ $L_\odot$ and $4.90\pm0.32$ $L_\odot$. The light contributions of the three stars obtained from this modeling match well with those calculated from the observed spectra. The binary star parameters are in satisfactory agreement with evolutionary model predictions for age $t$ = 0.4 Gyr and metallicity $Z$ = 0.03. We extracted 11 significant frequencies from the TESS light residuals with the binary effects removed. Of these, five signals between 0.65 day$^{-1}$ and 1.89 day$^{-1}$ can be considered as $γ$ Dor pulsations originating mainly from the primary component, while the other frequencies are likely instrumental artifacts or combination terms. These results suggest that TIC 322208686 is a hierarchical triple, containing a pulsating eclipsing pair and a tertiary companion.

Additionally, intermediate high-mass and low-mass protostars have often been observed to form in crowded clusters, where the typical separation distance between any two cluster members is of the same order or smaller than the scale of the outflow length. Therefore, there must be an interaction between the molecular outflows of different protostars within the protostellar association. A good example of this is the case of Cepheus E-mm, which is a protostellar outflow extending over a few dozen au. At its core is a binary system consisting of two protostars, Cep E-A and Cep E-B, separated by about 1000 au. Both protostars eject molecular jets at velocities of ~100 km/s. The interaction between these molecular outflows provides an opportunity to study the effects of jet collisions in a clustered star-forming environment, as they may leave detectable imprints on the morphology of the main envelope of the system. Our work aims to study the effects of the collision of molecular jets associated with the components of the binary system Cep-A and Cep-E, analyzing the disruption or reduction of molecular emission in the main envelope of the system, which the molecular outflow { launched} by Cep-A presumably pushes.

In addition to our Hα images, we have obtained matched continuum images which we subtract to reveal faint emission, including a far more extensive network of optical knots and filaments than reported previously. The deepest images also show an extremely faint, fairly diffuse arc of emission surrounding much of the circumference of Tycho to the southeast and south, coinciding with the rim of the radio/X-ray shell. We have measured proper motions for 46 filaments, including many fainter ones near the Tycho outer rim. Our measurements are generally consistent with previous ones by Kamper and vandenBergh (1978), but ours have far greater precision. Most optical filaments at the shell rim have expansion indices reasonably consistent with the Sedov value (0.40), while the interior filaments have somewhat smaller values, as expected. From the combination of proper motions of filaments at the shell rim and shock velocity at the same positions, one should be able to calculate the distance to Tycho by simple geometry. Determination of the shock velocity from broad Balmer-line profiles is subject to model uncertainties, but the availability of dozens of such filaments with a range of conditions offers the possibility to substantially improve the distance determination for Tycho.

However, previous studies have been limited by inconsistent datasets, observational biases and methodological differences. This study investigates the compositional relationship between rocky exoplanets and their host stars, utilizing a self-consistent and homogeneous dataset of 21 exoplanets and their 20 host stars. By applying sophisticated interior structure modeling and comprehensive chemical analysis, we identify a potential 1:1 best-fit line between the iron-mass fraction of planets and their host stars equivalent with a slope of $m = 0.94^{+1.02}_{-1.07}$ and intercept of $c = -0.02^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$. This results are consistent at the 1$σ$ level with other homogeneous studies, but not with heterogeneous samples that suggest much steeper best-fit lines. Although, our results remain tentative due to sample size and data uncertainties, the updated dataset significantly reduces the number of super-Mercuries from four to one, but it remains that several high-density planets are beyond what a primordial origin would suggest. The planets in our sample have a wider range of compositions compared to stellar equivalent values, that could indicate formation pathways away from primordial or be the result of random scattering owing to current mass-radius uncertainties as we recover the observed outliers in mock population analysis $\sim15\%$ of the time. To truly determine whether the origin is primordial with a 1:1 true relation, we find that sample of at least 150 planets is needed and that stars that are iron enrich or depleted are high value targets.

  We find no evidence of H2 temperature or velocity stratification from the axis to the edge of the outflow, as would be expected in MHD disk-wind models and as observed in other outflows. Instead, the observations suggest that the H2 emission arises from shock interactions between jet bow shocks and/or wide-angle winds with the ambient medium and cavity walls. NIRSpec emission and velocity maps reveal expanding molecular shells, likely driven by the less luminous source in the binary system. We infer an accretion rate of less than 10^-9 solar masses per year for the secondary source, approximately one order of magnitude lower than that of the primary.
  The H2 emission is consistent with excitation by low-velocity (approximately 10 km/s) J-type shocks, irradiated by an external UV field that may originate from strong dissociative shocks driven by the atomic jet. Future JWST observations will further constrain the evolution of the expanding shell and the mechanisms driving the outflow.

      Mrutunjaya Bhuyan","In this study, we investigate the influence of an admixed fermionic dark matter (DM) component on the equilibrium structure of white dwarfs (WDs), with particular emphasis on the effects of varying the DM particle mass ($m_{\rm DM}$) and DM fraction ($f_{\rm DM}$). Notably, we employ a single-fluid approximation for the first time in this context, wherein the baryonic and DM contributions to the total energy density and pressure are treated within a unified framework, assuming non-interacting fermionic DM in hydrostatic equilibrium with baryons. We examine how variations in $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$ and $f_\mathrm{DM}$ modify the equation of state (EoS), the mass-radius relationship, and the internal mass and pressure distributions of WDs. Our results show that the presence of DM softens the EoS, with lighter DM particles providing stronger pressure support and leading to more extended stellar structures. Increasing the DM mass fraction leads to a more compact configuration, reducing both the radius and maximum mass of the WD. We further demonstrate that heavier DM particles enhance stellar compactness and can eventually drive the star toward gravitational instability. Moreover, the analysis of mass-radius relationships reveals that while small fractions of DM are consistent with observed WD masses, the radii predicted by our models are smaller than observations, suggesting additional influences such as rotation or magnetic fields. Our stability analysis confirms that the inclusion of dark matter does not lead to instability within the expected parameter space, indicating that white dwarfs admixed with dark matter can remain dynamically stable under certain conditions. These findings show that even a small admixture of DM can modify the structural properties and stability limits of WDs, providing a potential indirect astrophysical probe of DM particle properties.

"Spectral synthesis techniques for supernovae and kilonovae","      
      Anders Jerkstrand","Supernovae (SNe) and kilonovae (KNe) are the most violent explosions in cosmos, signalling the destruction of a massive star (core-collapse SN), a white dwarf (thermonuclear SN) and a neutron star (KN), respectively. The ejected debris in these explosions is believed to be the main cosmic source of most elements in the periodic table. However, decoding the spectra of these transients is a challenging task requiring sophisticated spectral synthesis modelling. Here, the techniques for such modelling is reviewed, with particular focus on the computational aspects. We build from a historical review of how methodologies evolved from modelling of stellar winds, to supernovae, to kilonovae, studying various approximations in use for the central physical processes. Similarities and differences in the numeric schemes employed by current codes are discussed, and the path towards improved models is laid out.

The spectrum is dominated by forceful single-peaked HI, HeI emissions and numerous double-peaked permitted and forbidden emissions of ions of chemical elements starting from the CNO triad up to metals (Mg, Al, Ti, V, Cr, Fe) with practically ``rectangular'' profiles. The FeII and [FeII] emissions predominate in the spectrum. However, several other double-peaked forbidden ion emissions were also detected: [VII], [Cr II], [Ni II]. The atlas is presented graphically, with a separate figure corresponding to each echelle order. A list of identified lines, including a number of known interstellar features is presented in table form. CI Cam supergiant status has been confirmed.

"Outbursts in ultra-compact AM CVn binaries","      
      Gavin Ramsay","AM CVn binaries are the most compact of accreting binaries having orbital periods in the range ~5-70 min. They consist of a white dwarf accreting hydrogen deficient material from a degenerate or semi-degenerate star and are predicted to be amongst the verification sources for future gravitational wave observatories such as LISA. Using the recent catalogue of Green et al (2025) I focus attention on the orbital period range in which outbursts are seen from AM CVn's. I examine in more detail the outburst properties of KL Dra which has an outburst every few months and has many sectors of TESS data as an open resource. Using observational data on the outbursting systems in general, I compare the outburst recurrence time, duration and amplitude as a function of orbital period with the predictions of the disc instability model. The recurrence time is well described, although there is some evidence that the amount of material in the disc at the end of the quiescence phase is less than earlier model assumptions. The distribution of the outburst duration appears to be dependent on the cadence of the observations and how it is defined. Similarly the amplitude distribution is dependent on cadence and the filter, which causes an apparent spread in distribution. Both of these features need to be systematically studied using consistent benchmarks. AM CVn binaries remain an excellent sources to test models which aim to predict the properties of disc accreting systems.

      Luke Handley","Measuring the occurrence rates of celestial objects is a valuable way to study their origins and evolution. Giant planets and brown dwarfs produce large Doppler signatures that are easily detectable by modern instrumentation, and legacy radial velocity (RV) surveys have now achieved full orbital coverage for periods $\lesssim$30 years. However, the Doppler method's sensitivity to companion minimum mass $M_c \sin i$ -- as opposed to true mass $M_c$ -- prevents unambiguous characterization using RVs alone, as purported giant planets may be brown dwarfs or stars on inclined orbits. Here we combined legacy RVs with absolute astrometry to re-fit the orbits of 195 companions from the California Legacy Survey. Nearly 50% (8/18) of the ``brown dwarfs"" ($M_c \sin i$=13--80 $M_{Jup}$) we refit had true masses above 80 $M_{Jup}$. We incorporated our orbital posteriors and target sensitivity maps into a Poisson likelihood model to calculate occurrence as a function of true companion mass $M_c$ (0.8--80 $M_{Jup}$) and separation $a$ (0.3--30 AU). The semi-major axis distributions of objects in this range vary smoothly with mass, with Jupiter analogs favoring an abrupt increase in occurrence near 1 AU and brown dwarfs exhibiting a gradual enhancement at wider separations. Marginalized companion occurrence between 1--10 AU decreases smoothly with mass, with brown dwarfs having the lowest occurrence rate: $0.9^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$%. Jupiter analogs are 10 times as common as brown dwarfs per mass interval in this range, demonstrating that the brown dwarf desert extends to 10 AU. The smooth variation in these distributions disfavors a sharp transition mass between ``bottom-up"" core accretion and ``top-down"" gravitational instability formation mechanisms, and rather suggests that these processes may produce companions in overlapping mass ranges.

      Sanaea Rose","The detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in both young and old stellar populations suggests multiple formation pathways, beyond just young magnetars from core-collapse supernovae. A promising delayed channel involves the formation of FRB-emitting neutron stars through merger- or accretion-induced collapse of a massive white dwarf (WD). By simulating a realistic stellar population with both binaries and triples, we identify pathways to WD collapse that could produce FRB candidates. We find that (i) triple dynamics open new merger channels inaccessible to isolated binaries, significantly enhancing the overall merger rate; (ii) triple-induced mergers broaden the delay-time distribution, producing long-delay ($\gtrsim1$-8~Gyr) events largely independent of metallicity, alongside a shorter-delay population ($\lesssim100$~Myr) of rapid mergers; (iii) these long delays naturally yield FRBs in older environments such as quiescent host galaxies and galactic halos; (iv) when convolved with the cosmic star-formation history, binary channels track the star-formation rate ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 2$), while triple channels peak later ($z_{\rm peak} \sim 1$), giving a combined local source rate of $R_0 \approx 2\times10^4~{\rm Gpc^{-3}~yr^{-1}}$, consistent with observations; and (v) applying the same framework to Type~Ia supernovae, we find that triples extend the delay-time tail and roughly double the Ia efficiency relative to binaries, yielding rates and redshift evolution in good agreement with observations. If FRBs originate from the collapse of WDs, our results establish triples, alongside binaries, as a crucial and previously overlooked formation pathway whose predicted rates, host demographics, and redshift evolution offer clear tests for upcoming surveys.

"Disc breaking and parametric instability in warped accretion discs","      
      Loren E Held, 
      
      Gordon I. Ogilvie","We present the first local simulations of disc breaking/tearing in a warped accretion disc. Warps can arise due to a misalignment between the disc and the rotation axis of the central object, or a misalignment with the orbital plane of a binary (or planetary) companion. Warped discs can break into rings, as found in observations of circumbinary protoplanetary discs and global simulations of tilted discs around spinning black holes. In this work we isolate the mechanism of disc breaking in high-resolution, quasi-2D, local (shearing box), hydrodynamic simulations of a Keplerian disc. We consider the evolution of a free (unforced) warp in the wavelike ($α< H/r$) regime. At large warp amplitudes ($ψ_{\text{max}} \gtrsim 1$) the disc breaks into four rings on timescales of around 20 orbits which are separated by gaps of around $\sim 10H_0$. The warp exhibits a rich tapestry of small-scale dynamics, including horizontal sloshing motions, vertical oscillations or bouncing, warp steepening, and shocks. The shocks act as a source of enhanced dissipation which facilitates gap opening and thus disc breaking. At smaller warp amplitudes $ψ_{\text{max}} \lesssim 1$, for which we also develop a quasi-linear theory, the disc does not break, but instead exhibits hydrodynamic parametric instability. We also investigate the effect of viscosity: at small warp amplitudes the parametric instability is damped and the warp propagates as a pure bending wave, while at large warp amplitudes the emerging gaps are partially filled by viscous diffusion.

We introduce a hybrid deep learning architecture combining multimodal spectroscopic and photometric data from SDSS DR17. The model comprises a Multi-Layer Perceptron for numerical features and a CNN with a Vision Transformer for spectra, with three output heads for age, lifetime, and evolutionary stage prediction. Training labels are derived from MIST v1.2 isochrones, with evolutionary stage binned into five classes (Hot, Medium, Cool, Subgiant, Red Giant). We conduct multi-phase evaluation: Phase I explores model architectures and data balancing strategies, Phase II tunes architectural complexity, and Phase III optimizes the multi-task loss composition. The final model achieves a balance between precision (Age RMSE 0.093 in $\log(\mathrm{yrs})$) and physical realism. Monte Carlo Dropout confirms well-calibrated uncertainties, enabling meaningful astrophysical interpretation and establishing a new benchmark for multimodal stellar parameter estimation.

"Resolution and calibration effects in high contrast polarimetric imaging of circumstellar scattering regions","

      J. Ma","Many circumstellar dust scattering regions have been detected and investigated with polarimetric imaging. However, the quantitative determination of the intrinsic polarization and of dust properties is difficult because of complex observational effects. This work investigates instrumental convolution and polarimetric calibration effect for high contrast imaging polarimetry with the aim to define procedures for accurate measurements of the circumstellar polarization. For this we simulate the instrumental convolution and polarimetric cancellation effects for a Gaussian PSF and an extended PSF_{AO} typical for a modern adaptive optics system. Further, polarimetric zero-point corrections (zp-corrections) are simulated for different cases like coronagraphic observations or systems with barely resolved circumstellar scattering regions. We find that the PSF convolution reduces the integrated azimuthal polarization Q_phi for the scattering region while the net Stokes signals Q and U are not changed. For non-axisymmetric systems a spurious U_phi-signal is introduced. These effects are strong for compact systems but scattering regions can still be detected down to small separations while unresolved scattering regions can be constrained by the central Stokes Q,U signal. The smearing by PSF_{AO} produces an extended, low surface brightness polarization signal changing the angular distribution of the polarization, but the initial signal can be recovered partly from the Stokes Q and U quadrant pattern. A polarimetric zp-correction applied for the removal of offsets from instrumental or interstellar polarization depends on the selected reference region and can also introduce strong bias effects for the azimuthal distribution of the polarization signal. Strategies for the zp-correction are described for coronagraphic data or observations of partly unresolved systems.

The analysis reveals this target is an eclipsing binary system with $δ$ Scuti type pulsations from the primary component, rather than from the secondary as previously reported. The frequency analysis of three short-cadence data reveals 41 significant frequencies, including the orbital frequency ($f_{orb}$ = 0.827198 d$^{-1}$) due to orbital motion from binary system and the pulsational frequencies. Most of the pulsational signal lies in the frequency range of 20 - 32 d$^{-1}$, with amplitude between 0.3 and 8.8 mmag, in which seven peaks are identified as `independent' modes. The strongest one ($f_{3}$ = 28.499399 d$^{-1}$) likely corresponds to a high-order radial mode. In other peaks ($f_{7}$, $f_{10}$, and $f_{18}$), several pairs of multiplet structures centered on them are found. The fitting of spectral energy distribution (SED) using the collected photometry measurement of multiple bands reveals the effective temperatures of the primary and secondary components as $8348^{+230}_{-225}$~K and $4753^{+237}_{-229}$~K, respectively, which place the primary star in the classical pulsating instability zone. The characteristic light curve morphology and short orbital period are consistent with a tidally locked system. Based on the characteristics of amplitude spectra of pulsating stars in close binaries, the analysis of the multiplet structures reveals that three independent frequencies (i.e. $f_{7}$, $f_{10}$, and $f_{18}$) correspond to non-radial modes with $l = 2$, while the associated sidelobes are produced by the orbital motion. We highlight the potential of this method in future studies of pulsating binary stars.

However, stellar variability can have major consequences for the evolution of planetary climates. In this work, we evaluate how stellar variability influences the equilibrium temperature and water retention of planets within the Habitable Zone (HZ). We present a sample of 9 stars that are known to host at least one planet within the HZ and that were identified to have a variability amplitude exceeding 100 ppm based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We investigate the effect that the variability of these stars have on the insolation flux of their HZ planets and the resulting changes in the induced planetary equilibrium temperature. Our results show that for the stars in our sample, the stellar variability has an insignificant effect on the equilibrium temperature of HZ planets. However, we also emphasize that these stars are not representative of more extreme variable stars, since exoplanets are more difficult to detect and characterize in the presence of extreme variability. We also investigate the equilibrium temperature and long-term evolution of a hypothetical Earth-like planet placed at the inner edge of the HZ around a highly variable star. We found that the water loss rates are comparable between both variable and quiet host stars for Earth-like planets in the inner HZ. Overall, these results broaden our knowledge on the impact of stellar variability on planetary habitability.

Yet the properties of dust, particularly the grain size distribution, in these systems remain uncertain. We present Band 6 observations of WR 112 by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array telescope (ALMA), which are the first millimeter observations of a WC binary system capable of resolving its dust emission. By combining ALMA observations with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) images, we were able to analyze the spatially resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) of WR 112. We found that the SEDs are consistent with emissions from hydrogen-poor amorphous carbon grains. Notably, our results also suggest that the majority of grains in the system have radii below one micrometer, and the extended dust structures are dominated by nanometer-sized grains. Among four parameterizations of the grain radius distribution that we tested, a bimodal distribution, with abundant nanometer-sized grains and a secondary population of 0.1-micron grains, best reproduces the observed SED. This bimodal distribution helps to reconcile the previously conflicting grain size estimates reported for WR 112 and for other WC systems. We hypothesize that dust destruction mechanisms such as radiative torque disruption and radiative-driven sublimation are responsible for driving the system to the bimodal grain size distribution.

"Refractive neutrino masses in the solar DM halo: Can the dark-LMA solution be revived?","

      Amol Dighe","Neutrinos can acquire ""refractive masses"" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.

      Shirley Ho","Conditional diffusion models provide a natural framework for probabilistic prediction of dynamical systems and have been successfully applied to fluid dynamics and weather prediction. However, in many settings, the available information at a given time represents only a small fraction of what is needed to predict future states, either due to measurement uncertainty or because only a small fraction of the state can be observed. This is true for example in solar physics, where we can observe the Sun's surface and atmosphere, but its evolution is driven by internal processes for which we lack direct measurements. In this paper, we tackle the probabilistic prediction of partially observable, long-memory dynamical systems, with applications to solar dynamics and the evolution of active regions. We show that standard inference schemes, such as autoregressive rollouts, fail to capture long-range dependencies in the data, largely because they do not integrate past information effectively. To overcome this, we propose a multiscale inference scheme for diffusion models, tailored to physical processes. Our method generates trajectories that are temporally fine-grained near the present and coarser as we move farther away, which enables capturing long-range temporal dependencies without increasing computational cost. When integrated into a diffusion model, we show that our inference scheme significantly reduces the bias of the predicted distributions and improves rollout stability.

In this study, we employ the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model in conjunction with our newly developed Synthetic Active Region Generator (SARG) to construct a catalog of synthetic active regions (ARs) spanning Solar Cycles 1-24 (1755-2020). We use the SIDC/SILSO sunspot number version 2.0 as the sole input governing the properties of the synthetic ARs in this catalog. This SARG catalog is then incorporated into the AFT model, which simulates the emergence of new ARs on the Sun, which are then transported under the influence of surface flows to produce maps of the full-Sun radial photospheric magnetic field over the entire 265-year period. We modulate the active region tilt for each cycle in order to ensure that the polar fields are consistent with the solar cycle amplitudes. We find that the polar fields derived from these simulations exhibit excellent correlation (r > 0.8) with observational proxies, including polar faculae counts and Ca ii K polar network indices. Daily synchronic maps from these simulations for the entire 265-year period are made publicly available to support a wide range of applications beyond those presented in this work.

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) adds a unique combination of long baseline and all-sky coverage, though extracting light curves from full-frame images (FFIs) is challenging due to scattered light and blending. We processed TESS FFIs to produce TEQUILA (TESS quick-look and light curve analysis), a comprehensive catalog of variable point sources from the prime mission, enabling diverse studies without requiring raw data processing. We used difference image analysis, constructing reference images from quality-filtered FFIs for each CCD across sectors 1-26. Iterative subtraction mitigated systematics, and light curves were created using aperture photometry for sources varying in residual images. The pipeline yields over six million light curves, including stellar variables, transients, systematics, and moving objects. Approximately $6 \times 10^5$ span multiple sectors, with roughly $10^3$ from continuous viewing zones. We achieve median differential variability noise of $10^{-3}$ to $10^0$ for sources between 5.0 and 16.0 Tmag, while typical photometric RMS variability ranges from $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$. A convolutional neural network identifies light curves caused by instrumental noise, assigning a confidence score to each classification. To avoid confusion with astrophysical variables, we also flag light curves prompted by known Solar System objects (SSOs). All light curves are accessible via MAST as a High-Level Science Product. This catalog serves as a discovery tool for new variables; future work will refine methods and extend coverage to the TESS extended mission.

"Centennial solar EUV irradiance from ionospheric currents: Varying sunspot-EUV irradiance relation and modified spot-facula ratio","      
      Kalevi Mursula","Sunspots depict large variability during the last 100 years, a period called the Modern Maximum (MM). However, other variables are needed to study the long-term evolution, e.g., of weaker fields and different radiative emissions. Recently, the relation between sunspots and the F10.7 and F30 radio fluxes and the MgII index (proxies of EUV irradiance) was found to vary during the last 70 years so that a relative sunspot dominance over EUV in the 1950s-1960s changed to EUV dominance in the 2000s (Mursula et al., 2024). Here we use data from eight long-operating observatories to calculate the yearly range of daily variation of the geomagnetic Y-component, the rY index, for the last 137 years. The rY index correlates very well with the MgII index and the solar F30 radio flux. These three indices have no trend relative to each other. On the other hand, the F10.7 flux has a significant trend with respect to the three co-varying EUV indices (MgII, F30, rY). Therefore, the rY index replaces F10.7 as the best long-term EUV proxy, and extends the MgII index by 90 years. We verify that all the four EUV proxies (rY, MgII, F30, F10.7) have an increasing trend with respect to sunspots during the last 50-70 years. This is valid both for sunspot numbers and group numbers. We find that the relation between rY index and sunspots has a quadratic evolution over the MM. The Sun has more sunspots relative to EUV irradiance during the growth and maximum of the MM, while the opposite is true during its decay. We estimate that the MgII index increases by 24\% of its solar cycle variation with respect to the sunspot number during the last 70 years. Our results indicate a systematic difference in the evolution between sunspots (photosphere) and plages (chromosphere) with long-term solar activity. The implied varying spot-facula ratio has consequences to the stellar evolution of the Sun and Sun-like stars.

PLATOs exceptional photometric precision, long-duration continuous monitoring, and extensive sky coverage promise transformative advances in white dwarf asteroseismology. Our key objectives include probing the internal structure and chemical stratification of white dwarfs, detecting secular changes in pulsation modes over extended timescales, and discovering rare or previously unknown classes of pulsators. To assess feasibility, we constructed a sample of 650 white dwarf candidates identified within PLATOs Southern LOPS2 field using the PLATO complementary science catalogue combined with Gaia DR3, and derived atmospheric parameters through photometric modeling. This sample comprises 118 DA white dwarfs (including 23 ZZ Ceti candidates), and 41 non-DAs (including 35 DBV candidates). Simulated observations using PlatoSim demonstrate that PLATO will be capable of detecting white dwarf pulsation modes with amplitudes as low as 0.1 mma depending on stellar magnitude, observation duration, pixel location, and the number of contributing cameras. We provide detailed detection limits and visibility forecasts for known pulsators across a representative range of these parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize strong synergies with Gaia astrometry, TESS photometry, and targeted spectroscopic campaigns, which together will enable robust mode identification and detailed stellar modeling. Collectively, these efforts will unlock unprecedented insights into white dwarf origins, evolution and internal physics, and the fate of their planetary systems.

We conducted a 67-night, 199-day baseline white-light monitoring campaign centred on the globular cluster M3 aimed at characterizing stellar variability within the cluster while also assessing the photometric performance of the newly commissioned system. We report the discovery of four new SX Phoenicis variables (V301-304), confirm their cluster membership, and identify fundamental-mode pulsation in one, allowing an independent period-luminosity-based distance estimate to M3. We revisited 231 previously known RR Lyrae stars, providing updated period measurements for 203 and white-light amplitudes for 198. We detected Blazhko-like modulation in 53 stars and characterized the modulation parameters for 28. Notably, we measure periods and amplitudes for the unclassified variables V286 and V287 for the first time. We also identify three foreground flaring M dwarfs, and assess the feasibility of detecting microlensing events in M3, concluding that expected rates are negligible. Alongside the scientific results, we introduce a new correction technique for flat-field images affected by scattered light and present a full characterization of the observatory's photometric capabilities. These results demonstrate the scientific utility of TWIST for high-cadence time-domain surveys using modest-aperture instrumentation.

Understanding this balance is a major topic in astrochemistry. Comparing the chemical composition of the envelope and the protoplanetary disk is key to solving the topic. The goal of this paper is to investigate the chemical differences between the disk and the surrounding envelope by comparing the column density ratios of a few selected species in each region. The source we focus on is HL Tau. We present new NOEMA observations of HL Tau targeting the following species: CS, H2CO, H2S, and SO2. We produced zeroth-, first-, and second-moment maps for the species where emission was detected and used them to analyze the spatial distribution and kinematic properties of the different molecules in the disk and the envelope. We derived the column densities and compared the values derived for the envelope and disk. We also computed the rotational diagram for the SO2 detected transitions. Assuming two different temperature regimes, 17 and 58 K, we derived column densities for the species surveyed in the disk and compared them with values derived for the envelope. We find large differences in the derived column density ratios of the surveyed molecules, especially for N(CS)/N(H2S), which is 40 to 50 times larger in the envelope. We attribute these variations to the different excitation and UV-irradiation regimes in the disk and envelope. We also note strong gradients in the ratios between different positions of the disk and tentatively attribute them to different levels of turbulence at different azimuths. The observed differences in molecular ratios in the envelope and the disk are suggestive of chemical reprocessing of the gas during the formation and evolution of the protoplanetary disk.

These events accelerate electrons, generating hard X-ray emissions and often display Quasi Periodic Pulsations (QPPs) across the energy spectra. However, the energy transfer process remains poorly constrained, with competing theories proposing different acceleration mechanisms. We investigate electron acceleration and transport in a flaring coronal loop by solving a time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation. Our model incorporates transient turbulent acceleration, simulating the effects of impulsive energy input to emulate the dynamics of time-dependent reconnection processes. We compute the density-weighted electron flux, a diagnostic directly comparable to observed X-ray emissions, across the energy and spatial domains from the corona to the chromosphere. We investigate different time-dependent functional forms of the turbulent acceleration, finding that the functional form of the acceleration source maintains its signature across energy bands (1 to 100 keV) with a response time that is energy dependent (with higher energy bands displaying a longer response time). In addition, we find that (a) for a square pulse the switch on and off response time is different; (b) for a sinusoidal input the periodicity is preserved; and (c) for a damped sinusoidal the decay rate increases with density and higher energy bands lose energy faster. This work presents a novel methodology for analyzing electron acceleration and transport in flares driven by time-dependent sources.

We first tested the feasibility of our method using Fourier local correlation tracking (FLCT) to track physical quantities at different optical depths ($\logτ_{500}={-1,-2,-3,-4}$) in an atmosphere simulated with the MURaM code. We then inferred the horizontal distribution of the LOS magnetic field component from synthetic spectropolarimetric observations of Fe I 525.0 nm and Mg I b2 spectral lines, applied FLCT to the time sequence of these synthetic magnetograms, and compared our findings with the original height-dependent horizontal velocities. Tracking the LOS magnetic field component (which coincides with the vertical component at the disk center) yields horizontal velocities that, after appropriate temporal and spatial averaging, agree excellently with the horizontal component of the simulated velocities, both calculated at constant $τ_{500}$ surfaces, up to the temperature minimum ($\logτ_{500}=-3$). When tracking the temperature at constant $τ_{500}$ surfaces, this agreement already breaks down completely at the mid photosphere ($\logτ_{500}=-2$). Tracking the vertical component of the magnetic field inferred from synthetic observations of the Fe I 525.0 nm and the Mg I b2 spectral lines yields a satisfactory inference of the horizontal velocities in the mid-photosphere ($\logτ_{500}\approx-1$) and the temperature minimum ($\logτ_{500}\approx-3$), respectively. Our results indicate that high-spatial-resolution spectropolarimetric imaging in solar spectral lines can provide meaningful information about the horizontal plasma velocities over a range of heights.

In addition to these observations, KoSO has preserved hand-drawn suncharts (1904-2022), on which various solar features such as sunspots, plages, filaments, and prominences are marked on the Stonyhurst grid with distinct colour coding. In this study, we present the first comprehensive result that includes the entire data set from these suncharts using a supervised Machine Learning model called ""Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)"", firstly to identify the solar disks from the charts (1909-2007), secondly to identify the plages, spanning 9 solar cycles (1916-2007). We train the CNN with the manually identified solar disk and plage. We first detect the solar limb and the North-South line in the suncharts, which enables the extraction of disk centre coordinates, radius, and P-angle. Following that, we use a CNN similar architecture to achieve accurate image segmentation for the identification of plages. We compare plage areas derived from the suncharts with those obtained from Ca II K full-disk observations, and find good agreement that demonstrates the potential application of such an ML technique for historical data. The results of this study further demonstrate the potential application of sunchart data to fill the existing data gaps in the KoSO multi-wavelength observations and contribute toward constructing a composite series over the last century.

      , et al. (13 additional authors not shown)","The inner regions of planet-forming disks hold invaluable insights for our understanding of planet formation. The disk around the Herbig star HD 100453 presents one such environment, with an inner disk that is significantly misaligned with respect to the outer disk. This paper expands the existing H-band (PIONIER) and K-band (GRAVITY) interferometric studies of the HD 100453 inner disk to the L-band with the MATISSE VLTI instrument. With snapshot data spanning approximately four years we aim for a more comprehensive understanding of the inner disk structures and their potential time evolution. Based on the MATISSE data obtained, we use a combination of analytical models and image reconstruction to constrain the disk structure. Additionally, we fit a temperature gradient model to the selected wavelength range of PIONIER, GRAVITY and MATISSE to derive physical properties of the inner regions. Our parametric model finds an inclination of $\sim 47.5^\circ$ and a position angle of $\sim 83.6^\circ$, which corroborates the case of strong inner-outer disk misalignment. From the symmetric temperature gradient we derive an inner disk radius around $\sim0.27$ au, with dust surface densities of $Σ_{\rm{subl}} \approx 10^{-3.2}$ g/cm$^2$ and vertical optical depth $τ_{\rm{z, subl}} \approx 0.1-0.06$. Same-night MATISSE and GRAVITY observations indicate the necessity for higher-order asymmetries to explain the interferometric signals, which is further supported by a MATISSE snapshot image reconstruction. The chromatic interferometric data reveal the likely need for higher-order asymmetries to explain the inner disk of HD~100453, suggesting a possible origin in dynamic interactions or disk instabilities. Coordinated multi-wavelength infrared interferometric observations with GRAVITY and MATISSE will be crucial to confirm these findings and uncover its underlying nature.

      Zuddas Pierpaolo","Whether planetary motions influence the solar magnetic cycle has remained an open question due to the lack of a rigorous physical mechanism. Here we develop a Lagrangian framework based on the Virial theorem to show that planetary orbital angular momentum modulates the Sun's rotation through barycentric dynamics, consistent with angular momentum conservation. Using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) applied to sunspot number (SSN) and terrestrial length-of-day (LOD) records spanning the past 250 years, we identify two non-linear trends plus 11 common pseudo-cycles whose periods match those of planetary resonances (LR$^{*}$). We then demonstrate that a reduced nonlinear $α-Ω$ dynamo model, forced solely by the summed planetary right ascension RA(t), reproduces both the Schwabe cycle and its multi-decadal envelope, including the Dalton Minimum and the Modern Maximum. These results provide strong evidence, based on a physically-grounded model, that the solar dynamo is weakly forced by planetary motion, suggesting that the solar dynamo, classically viewed as autonomous, may in fact behave as a synchronized system.

Hence, a real-time triggering system is needed for solar observations with the versatile new-generation radio telescopes to efficiently capture these episodes of solar activity with the precious and limited solar observing time. We have developed such a system, Solar Triggered Observations of Radio bursts using MWA and Yamagawa (STROMY) for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the precursor for the low frequency telescope of upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO). It is based on near-real-time data from the Yamagawa solar spectrograph, located at a similar longitude to the MWA. We have devised, implemented, and tested algorithms to perform an effective denoising of the data to identify signatures of solar activity in the Yamagawa data in near real-time. End-to-end tests of triggered observations have been successfully carried out at the MWA. STORMY is operational at the MWA for the routine solar observations, a timely development in the view of the ongoing solar maximum. We present this new observing framework and discuss how it can enable efficient capturing of event-rich solar data with existing instruments, like the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) etc., and pave the way for triggered observing with the SKAO, especially the SKA-Low.

All target systems also had available space-based TESS time-series data. Orbital period variations were studied for eight target systems, showing either linear or parabolic trends. The target systems exhibiting parabolic trends demonstrated a sustained decrease in their orbital periods over time. We modeled the light curves utilizing the PHOEBE Python code in combination with the BSN application. We revisited the relationship between orbital period and the temperature of the hotter component in contact binary systems using an empirical approach. Our analysis identified a clear break at P=0.27 days, separating the systems into two distinct groups for orbital periods shorter than 0.6 days. Following the determination of stellar extinction, absolute parameters for seven systems were estimated employing parallax measurements from Gaia DR3. Based on the components' effective temperatures and masses, the systems were classified into A- and W-subtypes. Their evolutionary states were illustrated using mass-radius and mass-luminosity diagrams.

WASP-12b is a hot Jupiter on a 1.1-day orbit around a slightly evolved F-type star. Its observed orbital decay rate, $|\dot{P}_{\rm orb}/P_{\rm orb}| \approx 3.2\,\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$, provides a strong constraint on stellar tidal dissipation. We confirm that linear tides with radiative damping and convective damping, as currently implemented, are not sufficient to reproduce the observed inspiral timescale. Nevertheless, our calculations, based on fully non-adiabatic forced oscillations in MESA stellar models with convective envelopes, yield dissipation rates that are consistent with previous semi-analytic and adiabatic estimates, confirming the robustness of our numerical framework. As the only open-source, actively maintained tool capable of computing orbital evolution in exoplanet systems, GYRE-tides provides a benchmark calculation for WASP-12 and future applications. Our results validate GYRE-tides as a tool for analyzing combined radiative and convective damping, and indicate that the observed decay rate requires tidal dissipation operating in or near the fully damped regime, which may be achieved through nonlinear damping. These contributions could also be evaluated by computing the wave luminosity at the radiative-convective boundary using our tool. GYRE-tides offers an open-source framework for computing tidal dissipation in short-period exoplanet systems, including the many systems expected to show orbital decay in upcoming Roman surveys.

A new estimate of the systematic shift of the Gaia parallax zero point relative to the inertial coordinate system has been obtained: $Δπ=-0.038\pm0.011$ mas.

Since YSOs and AGB stars share similar infrared (IR) photometric characteristics due to comparable temperatures and the presence of circumstellar dust, distinguishing them is challenging and often leads to misclassification. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have helped reduce YSO-AGB misclassifications, achieving a reliable separation remains challenging. Given that YSOs and AGB stars exhibit distinct light curves resulting from different variability mechanisms, our Double Filter Model leverages light curve data to enhance classification accuracy. This approach uncovered YSOs and AGB stars that were misclassified in IR photometry and was validated against Taurus YSOs and spectroscopically confirmed AGB stars. We applied the model to the {\it Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO Catalog for the Inner Galactic Midplane} (SPICY) catalog for catalog refinement and identified potential AGB star contaminants.

The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways -- a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.

      Takashi Sekii","Theoretical study of high-order gravity-mode period spacing ($ΔP_g$) pattern is relevant for the better understanding of internal properties of intermediate-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot < M < 8 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence g-mode pulsators. In this paper, we carry out the first-order perturbative analysis to evaluate effects of a sharp, though not discontinuous, transition in the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency on the $ΔP_g$ pattern. Such a finite-width transition in the BV frequency, whose scale height can be comparable to the local wavelength of gravity waves, is expected to develop in relatively low-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot < M < 3 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence stars, causing a bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency. Inspired by Unno et al.'s formulation, we treat the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency as a small perturbation, which allows us to derive an analytical expression of the $ΔP_g$ pattern. The analytical expression shows that the amplitude of the oscillatory $ΔP_g$ pattern is determined by a weighted average of the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency where the weighting function is given by the g-mode eigenfunction. Tests with low-mass ($\sim 2 \, M_\odot$) main-sequence stellar models show that the analytical expression can reproduce the $ΔP_g$ patterns numerically computed reasonably well. The results of our perturbative analysis will be useful for, e.g., improving semi-analytical expressions of the $ΔP_g$ pattern, which would enable us to investigate $ΔP_g$ patterns of SPB stars and $γ$ Dor stars for inferring chemical composition profile and rotation rates.

COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R~2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup). We identify absorption feature differences which could indicate that 0825+2805 has stronger vertical mixing.

Among them are the relatively rare $γ$ Doradus / $δ$ Scuti ($γ$ Dor / $δ$ Sct) hybrid pulsators, which have been previously studied using Kepler data. These stars are perfect laboratories to probe both inner and outer interior stellar layers thanks to them exhibiting both pressure and gravity modes. We seek to classify an all-sky sample of AF stars observed by TESS to find previously undiscovered hybrid pulsators and supply them in a catalogue of candidates. We also aim to compare the light curves produced with the TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) pipeline, currently underused in variability studies, with other publicly available light curves. We compared dominant and secondary frequencies of confirmed hybrid pulsators in Kepler, extended mission Quick Look Pipeline (QLP) data, and nominal and extended mission TGLC data. We then used a feature-based positive unlabelled (PU) learning classifier to search for new hybrid pulsators amongst TESS AF stars and investigated the properties of the detected populations. We find that the variability of confirmed hybrids in TGLC agrees well with the one occurring in QLP light curves and has a high recovery rate of \kepler-extracted frequencies. Our `smart binning' method allows for robust extraction of hybrids from large unlabelled datasets, with an average out-of-bag prediction for test set hybrids at 93.04\%. The analysis of dominant frequencies in high-probability candidates shows that we find more pressure-mode dominant hybrids. Our catalogue includes 62,026 new candidate light curves from the nominal and extended TESS missions, with individual probabilities of being a hybrid in each available sector.

The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses.

The current paradigm invokes outflows driven by photon scattering on relatively large grains ($\sim0.3\,μ$m), but whether such grains exist in sufficient quantities remains uncertain.
  We test whether the dust around the oxygen-rich AGB star R~Doradus can drive its wind by combining polarimetric constraints, elemental abundance limits, and force-balance calculations. We examine Fe-free silicates (MgSiO$_3$), alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), and Fe-bearing silicates (MgFeSiO$_4$) to evaluate whether any species can produce enough radiative pressure under realistic conditions.
  Using high-angular-resolution polarimetric observations from SPHERE/ZIMPOL at the VLT, we model the circumstellar dust with RADMC-3D and explore a broad parameter space in grain size, density structure, and wavelength-dependent stellar radius. For models consistent with the observations, we assess wind feasibility using updated gas-density profiles, elemental depletion constraints, and radiation-pressure thresholds.
  Although several dust configurations reproduce the observed scattering patterns, none generate sufficient radiative force at realistic gas-to-dust ratios, even under maximal elemental depletion. Our results for R~Doradus indicate that photon scattering on dust cannot by itself launch the wind, implying that additional mechanisms must contribute.

In addition, we investigate the impact of various angular reconstruction methods and compare the ``3-species'' and ``4-species'' neutrino transport schemes. We find that the FFC effects are insensitive to the different methods tested and that the FFC alters supernova hydrodynamics is only minor ways. We also present a ``quasi-equipartition'' approximation which can be used to estimate the FFC-altered neutrino properties by post-processing the neutrino signals extracted from no-oscillation CCSN simulations. The relative errors in neutrino number and energy luminosities of this phenomenological method are less than 2\% for 1D models, and less than 10\% for 2D models. This method provides a simple way to include the effects of FFC on neutrino signals without implementing a complex and expensive FFC scheme or redoing simulations.

      David H. Weinberg","Carbon (C) is thought to be produced by both core collapse supernovae (CCSN) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, but the relative contributions of these two sources are uncertain. We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate.

      Amedeo Romagnolo","I present StarEstate, an open-source Python package for producing rapid, statistically robust galactic population synthesis models. By utilizing optimized pre-calculated inverse-cumulative distribution function samplers, the tool generates synthetic populations from pre-generated grids of stellar tracks orders of magnitude faster than traditional numerical integration methods. A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments. StarEstate's features allow the user to predict spatial distributions of diverse stellar objects, providing a flexible resource for interpreting galactic surveys.

Two mechanisms are commonly invoked to explain their origin, the binary supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the kinematic properties of runaway stars is key to understanding their origins.We intend to investigate the origins of 39 B-type runaway stars from LAMOST using orbital traceback analysis. From the catalog of LAMOST, we selected 39 B-type runaway stars and determined their spectral subtypes from key absorption lines. We then derived atmospheric parameters for each star using the Stellar Label Machine (SLAM), which is trained on TLUSTY synthetic spectra computed under the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) assumption. Using the derived atmospheric parameters as input, we estimated stellar masses and ages with a machine learning model trained on PARSEC evolutionary tracks. We finally performed orbital traceback with GALPY to analyze their origins. Through orbital traceback, we find that 29 stars have trajectories entirely within the Galactic disk, whereas 10 are disk-passing yet still trace back to the disk. Two stars have trajectories that intersect those of known clusters. Their orbits show similar morphologies in both the $X-Y$ and $R-Z$ planes, and their [M/H] values are comparable, suggesting possible cluster origins. However, definitive confirmation will require additional evidence. In addition, the $V_{\rm Sp} - v\sin{i}$ plane shows that runaway stars with low peculiar space velocities but high $v\sin{i}$ remain on the Galactic disk, whereas those with high peculiar space velocities but low $v\sin{i}$ pass through the disk, possibly reflecting two distinct origins.

As a result, accurate solar flare prediction has emerged as a central topic in space weather research. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in the field of solar flare forecasting, driven by the rapid advancements in space observation technology and the continuous improvement of data processing capabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the current state of research in this area, with a particular focus on tracing the evolution of data-driven approaches -- which have progressed from early statistical learning techniques to more sophisticated machine learning and deep learning paradigms, and most recently, to the emergence of Multimodal Large Models (MLMs). Furthermore, this study examines the realistic performance of existing flare forecasting platforms, elucidating their limitations in operational space weather applications and thereby offering a practical reference for future advancements in technological optimization and system design.

Over a 15-minute period, we identify complex, superimposed spectro-temporal structures, including: (1) broadband, second-long modulation lanes with downward frequency drifts, (2) narrowband ($\approx$ 50 MHz), short-duration S-burst envelopes with upward drifts, and (3) even narrower ($\approx$ 10 MHz), millisecond-scale S-burst striae within these envelopes. Using the discrete Fourier transform and auto-correlation function, we identify two dominant periodic emission patterns, corresponding to the periodicities of the S-bursts ($\approx0.1$ s) and the striae ($\approx0.01$ s). The complex superposition of diverse time-frequency structures poses a challenge to interpreting all the emission variability as intrinsic to the source. We propose that the modulation lanes could be a propagation effect as the radio waves traverse an inhomogeneous, regularly structured plasma region in the AD Leo's magnetosphere. By modelling a plasma screen with sinusoidal phase variation in one dimension, we show that we could qualitatively reconstruct the observed modulation lanes. The origin of the finest structures, the striae, remains unclear. Our work highlights that propagation effects in the stellar magnetosphere can potentially probe kilometre-scale structures in the emission regions and provide novel constraints on density inhomogeneities caused by magnetohydrodynamic waves that are difficult to access by other means.

While for the former, heavy-ion collisions (HIC) represent a unique opportunity to constraint the EOS in a controlled laboratory setting, the latter can be precisely probed thanks to the advent of multi-messenger astronomy (MMA). However, as we move away from our understanding drawn from individual sources and limited statistics to the era of precision physics with improved datasets, the need for a systematic way to combine them becomes clear. In this article, we trace the individual methods for extracting the EOS both for HIC and MMA. We then review the current state-of-the-art efforts to combine these individual information sources from Bayesian multi-source analysis, e.g., the Nuclear Physics and Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (NMMA) and Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) frameworks, and fully integrated EOS frameworks, i.e., the Modular Unified Solver for the Equation of State (MUSES) calculation engine. We highlight the scientific advances made possible by each step and outline the remaining challenges that must be addressed to build a coherent, predictive picture of dense nuclear matter across all relevant regimes.

In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hours of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching ~4 $μ$Jy for periodic emission and ~10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the non-detections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old ($\gtrsim$ 10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches.

Solar filaments often exhibit rotation and deflection during eruptions, which would significantly affect the geoeffectiveness of the coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that lead to such lateral displacement of filaments is a great concern to space weather forecasting. Two case studies are discussed. Firstly, the events of September 8 and September 10 2014, were analyzed from the Sun to the Earth. The numerical heliospheric simulation EUHFORIA shows that the handedness of the EUV sigmoid deduced from coronagraph observations was different from the tilt of the ICME at 1~au, suggesting a rotation of the CME in the low corona. A potential undetected low coronal rotation led to erroneous space weather prediction. The second event concerns a filament observed on August 20 2021, which underwent a rotation of 73 degrees during its eruption, implying a significant lateral drifting of the filament material. A data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation confirms such a rotation. These two studies reinforce the idea that CMEs are subjected to more significant rotation and deflection in the low corona than during their journey in the heliosphere.

At the end of stable mass transfer, there is a well-known relation between the He WD mass and orbital period. Although this relation has been widely investigated, the influence of different types of opacity at low temperatures is ignored. In this work, we modeled the evolution of WD binaries with stellar evolution code MESA and two types of opacity at low temperatures from Ferguson et al. (2005) and Freedman et al. (2008, 2014). We investigated the relation between the WD mass and orbital period and compared these results with observations. We find that the relation derived from the opacity of Freedman et al. (2008, 2014) is below that from the opacity of Ferguson et al. (2005) and the relation derived from the opacity of Freedman et al. (2008, 2014) can better explain the observations. In addition, we provided fitting formulae for the relations derived from the opacity of Freedman et al. (2008,2014) at different metallicities.

      , et al. (108 additional authors not shown)","Direct astrometric detection of exomoons remains unexplored. This study presents the first application of high-precision astrometry to search for exomoons around substellar companions. We investigate whether the orbital motion of the companion HD 206893 B exhibits astrometric residuals consistent with the gravitational influence of an exomoon or binary planet. Using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument, we monitored the astrometric positions of HD 206893 B and c across both short (days to months) and long (yearly) timescales. This enabled us to isolate potential residual wobbles in the motion of component B attributable to an orbiting moon. Our analysis reveals tentative astrometric residuals in the HD 206893 B orbit. If interpreted as an exomoon signature, these residuals correspond to a candidate (HD 206893 B I) with an orbital period of approximately 0.76 years and a mass of $\sim$0.4 Jupiter masses. However, the origin of these residuals remains ambiguous and could be due to systematics. Complementing the astrometry, our analysis of GRAVITY $R=4000$ spectroscopy for HD 206893 B confirms a clear detection of water, but no CO is found using cross-correlation. We also find that AF Lep b, and $β$ Pic b are the best short-term candidates to look for moons with GRAVITY+. Our observations demonstrate the transformative potential of high-precision astrometry in the search for exomoons, and proves the feasibility of the technique to detect moons with masses lower than Jupiter and potentially down to less than Neptune in optimistic cases. Crucially, further high-precision astrometric observations with VLTI/GRAVITY are essential to verify the reality and nature of this signal and attempt this technique on a variety of planetary systems.

These parameters are calibrated using LAMOST F, G or K dwarf companions ([Fe/H]), and APOGEE Net ($T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log{g}$), respectively. Comparisons of SLAM predicted [Fe/H] values between two components of M+M dwarfs wide binaries show no bias but with a scatter of 0.11 dex. Further comparisons with two other works, which also calibrated the [Fe/H] of M dwarfs by using the F/G/K companions, reveal biases of -0.06$\pm$0.16 dex and 0.02$\pm$0.14 dex, respectively. The SLAM-derived effective temperatures agree well with the temperature which is calibrated by using interferometric angular diameters (bias: -27$\pm$92 K) and those of the LAMOST (bias: -34$\pm$65 K), but are systematically lower than those from an empirical relationship between the color index and $T_{\rm eff}$ by 146$\pm$45 K. The SLAM surface gravity aligns well with those of LAMOST (bias: -0.01$\pm$0.07 dex) and those derived from the stellar mass and radius (bias: -0.04$\pm$0.09 dex). Finally, we investigated a bias in [Fe/H] between SLAM and APOGEE ASPCAP. It depends on ASPCAP's [Fe/H] and $T_{\rm eff}$, we provide an equation to correct the ASPCAP metallicities.

The solar wind plays an important role in forming the large-scale coronal structure and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are used to reproduce it for further studying coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We conduct a data-constrained MHD simulation of the global solar corona including solar wind effects of the 2024 April 8 TSE with observed magnetograms using the Message Passing Interface Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) within 2.5 $R_\odot$. This TSE happened within the solar maximum, hence the global corona was highly structured. Our MHD simulation includes the energy equation with a reduced polytropic index $γ=1.05$. We compare the global magnetic field for multiple magnetograms and use synchronic frames from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager to initialize the magnetic field configuration from a magneto-frictionally equilibrium solution, called the Outflow field. We detail the initial and boundary conditions employed to time-advance the full set of ideal MHD equations such that the global corona is relaxed to a steady state. The magnetic field, the velocity field, and distributions of the density and thermal pressure are successfully reproduced. We demonstrate direct comparisons with TSE images in white-light and Fe XIV emission augmented with quasi-separatrix layers, the integrated current density, and the synthetic white-light radiation, and find a good agreement between simulations and observations. This provides a fundamental background for future simulations to study the triggering and acceleration mechanisms of CMEs under solar wind effects.

      Bradley E. Schaefer","A popular solution to the Type Ia supernova (SNIa) progenitor problem is that the immediate progenitors are symbiotic star systems. This solution requires that the companion star of the exploding white dwarf must be a red giant star with a heavy stellar wind. This has been tested for 189 normal SNIa, with all tested systems being proven to not have the required red giant: (A) Zero-out-of-9 normal type Ia supernova remnants have any red giant ex-companion star near the center with limits of $M_V$$>$0.0. (B) Zero-out-of-2 normal SNIa in nearby galaxies have any red giant at the position as seen in archival pre-eruption images by HST to limits of $M_V$$>$0.0. (C and D) Zero-out-of-111 normal SNIa have any detected hydrogen or helium emission lines in their eruption spectra, with limits on entrained gas of $M_{\rm H}$$<$0.22 and $M_{\rm He}$$<$0.07 M$_{\odot}$, which is the minimum mass lost by a red giant in a nearby blastwave. (E and F) Zero-out-of-9 nearby normal SNIa were detected in the radio or X-rays, as required from the ejecta/wind impact, to limits of $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$$<$3$\times$$10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. (G) Zero-out-of-$\sim$69 normal SNIa display any brightening in the first few days to limits of $M_V$$>$$-$18, as required for a red giant companion when we are looking down its shadowcone. With zero-out-of-189 normal SNIa having any possibility of having a red giant companion, the fraction of SNIa with symbiotic progenitors is $<$0.53%. The overwhelming conclusion is that normal SNIa are not from symbiotic-progenitors in any measurable fraction.

We present photometric observations along its inbound trajectory toward perihelion, together with a spectroscopic comparison to pristine carbonaceous chondrites from the NASA Antarctic collection. The spectral similarities indicate that 3I/ATLAS may be a primitive carbonaceous object, likely enriched in native metal and undergoing significant aqueous alteration during its approach to the Sun, experiencing cryovolcanism as we could expect for a pristine Trans-Neptunian Object. We propose that the combination of elevated metal abundance and abundant water ice can account for the unusual coma morphology and chemical products reported to date. To do so, corrosion of fine-grained metal grains can originate energetic Fischer-Tropsch reactions, generating specific chemical products into the coma that are not so common in other comets because most of them formed in the outer solar system and didn't inherited so much metal. Interstellar objects such as 3I/ATLAS provide rare opportunities to investigate physical and chemical processes in distant minor bodies of our own Solar System, including trans-Neptunian objects and Oort Cloud comets.

      M. Ireland","Long secondary periods (LSPs) occur in about one-third of evolved stars, yet their origin remains unclear. The leading explanations are oscillatory convective modes and a binary companion embedded in dust. We investigate the LSP of the red giant RT Pav using multi-wavelength VLTI interferometry (PIONIER, GRAVITY, MATISSE; 1.5-5.0 microns), obtained near the phase where a companion would appear most separated. These data, combined with photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, constrain possible companion masses, orbits, and photometric effects. We model the interferometric observables using uniform-disk, limb-darkened, ellipse, binary, and oscillatory convective dipole representations, supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Gaia limits any companion to a mass whose Roche-lobe volume is too small to hold the obscuring or scattering material required to reproduce the observed LSP modulation. While binary fits can yield low chi-squared values, the inferred positions are inconsistent across wavelength, closure phases do not increase with wavelength as dusty companions predict, and significant detections occur in only two of four bands. Theoretical estimates show that a roughly 1 percent flux companion at LSP-like separations should be consistently detectable for typical O-rich AGB dust, but is not consistently observed. In contrast, an oscillatory convective dipole with a temperature contrast of about 200 K reproduces the H-band morphology and visible-light amplitude without violating Gaia or photometric constraints, and binary-like residuals vanish when dipole models are fitted. Our results therefore favor oscillatory convective modes over a binary origin for the LSP in RT Pav. Time-resolved spectro-interferometry across the LSP cycle is a natural next step.

      Stuart D. Bale","Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed a high speed stream near the Sun ($\sim 9.8 R_\odot$) in March 2025. As this stream was observed near the Sun, it allowed for an unparalleled opportunity to observe pristine, coronal hole wind with little evolution (expansion, stream interaction, etc) effects impacting its properties. Through an ensemble of magnetic connectivity analysis utilizing Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) modeling and ballistic propagation, we make estimates of the footpoints, and corresponding source region parameters, associated with the stream. We then look at how the low variability regions (small gradient in the in-situ $B_r$) are related to the variability in the field strength at their source ($B_0$). We find that about half of these periods are associated with low source region variability. Lastly, we examine the low $δB / B$ periods between switchback patches and similarly find that they show statistically less variability in their associated $B_0$ value than their switchback patch counterparts. We believe that these results point to a solar source of these ``low-variability"" periods, that warrants further investigation with composition diagnostics and more complex modeling techniques.

"GANDALF: A hardware-agnostic spectral solver for kinetic reduced MHD turbulence","      
      Anjor Kanekar","We present GANDALF, a JAX-based spectral solver for Kinetic Reduced MHD (KRMHD) turbulence designed to lower infrastructure barriers to plasma turbulence research. Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfvén waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfvén waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfvén times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions.

These radio emissions are characterized by strong circular polarization, and appear to repeat within consistent orbital phase windows dictated by the orbital position of YZ Ceti b. If confirmed, this interaction would provide a first means to concretely assess the magnetic field of a close-in rocky exoplanet. This kind of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) should depend on both the exoplanetary orbit, and the geometry of the stellar magnetic field. In this article, we report measurements of the large-scale magnetic field topology of the star YZ Ceti for the first time, and interpret the cumulative radio data sets in that context to evaluate the plausibility of magnetic SPIs. We find evidence both against and in support of the SPI hypothesis, but crucially that the measured magnetic field does not rule out SPI scenarios. However, clear evaluation of these possibilities requires more accurate assessments of the magnetic field evolution across time. We additionally suggest that YZ Ceti may be exhibiting planet-induced flaring potentially triggered by exoplanet crossings of the Alfvén surface as the planet orbit approaches the stellar magnetic equator, and YZ Ceti b experiences dramatic shifts in the ambient field, its polarity, and connectivity to the host star.

These changes amount to 56,000 transition wavenumbers, 16,000 line intensities, 30,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3500 assignments. 40,000 new lines were added, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $ν_3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, gathered speed-independent pressure broadenings of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were used to fit Pade-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $ν_3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadenings were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.

While the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite initially designated the object as a planetary candidate, observing a 10-day transit and secondary eclipse in Sectors 8 and 35, we definitively exclude this scenario, finding instead that the transit comes from eclipsing stellar companions with $P = 9.599214$ days and $a = 0.1415$ AU. This binary orbits a single star at a wide separation of $ρ= 0.2946''$, determined through high-resolution AO and speckle imaging and corresponding to a $\sim$297 AU, $\sim$1886-year orbit at a distance of 1010 pc. Using transit data and photometry, we use EXOFASTv2 to fit the transit light curve, spectral energy distribution, and MIST evolutionary models of the three stars. We find that the isolated star and the larger binary star are massive A stars, with the single star having evolved off the main sequence, while the smaller companion is a G star. We also found an unusually low rotational velocity of 2.3 km/s from the single A star, observed from MINERVA and TRES RVs, implying a pole-on orientation. The triple-star architecture derived from multiple data sources made this target a complex system that required new capabilities within EXOFASTv2 to properly model. Our successful modeling demonstrates a new paradigm for false positive identification and classification that incorporates imaging, photometry, transits, and global modeling to definitively rule out false positives that may otherwise pollute candidate catalogs without extensive follow-up observations.

However, they can play an important role in stellar structure and evolution models through efficient angular momentum transport and their impact on internal mixing. We strive to explain the 9 components of one frequency multiplet, identified as a low-order quadrupole gravity mode detected in the light curve of the beta Cep pulsator HD 192575 assembled by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We update the frequencies of the quadrupole mode under investigation using a standard prewhitening method applied to the 1951.46 d TESS light curve, showing that an internal magnetic field is required to simultaneously explain all 9 components. We implement theoretical pulsation computations applicable to the low-order modes of a beta Cep pulsator including the Coriolis force, as well as a magnetic field that is misaligned with respect to the rotation axis. We apply the theoretical description to perform asteroseismic modelling of the amplitudes and frequencies in the multiplet of the quadrupole g-mode of this evolved beta Cep star. Pulsation predictions based on the measured internal rotation frequency of the star cannot explain the observed 9-component frequency splittings of the quadrupole low-order gravity mode. By contrast, we show that the combined effect of the Coriolis force caused by the near-core rotation with a period of about 5.3 d and the Lorentz force due to an internal inclined magnetic field with a maximum strength of around 24 kG does provide a proper explanation of the 9 multiplet frequencies and their relative amplitudes. Given the stellar mass of about 12 solar masses, this work presents the detection and magneto-gravito-asteroseismic modelling of a stable internal magnetic field buried inside an evolved rotating supernova progenitor.

If axions exist and couple to electrons, then axions could be produced at an appreciable rate in the electron-degenerate core of a white dwarf through axion bremsstrahlung from electrons. The emission of these axions would provide an additional cooling mechanism for white dwarfs that would affect the cooling rate, and hints of axions have been suggested based on observations of anomalous cooling reported for white dwarfs in the Galactic disc and halo. We performed stellar evolution simulations of white dwarf cooling that accounted for the additional energy loss due to axion bremsstrahlung from electrons, producing a suite of white dwarf cooling models for different values of the axion-electron coupling constant, as well as the white dwarf mass and envelope thickness. These cooling models are compared to observations of white dwarfs in 47 Tucanae from the Hubble Space Telescope through an unbinned likelihood analysis. The optimal model found by this analysis corresponds to the case of no axion emission with a thick white dwarf envelope, and we find a new bound on the axion-electron coupling of $g_{aee} \leq 0.81 \times 10^{-13}$ at 95% confidence level. This improves upon the previous white dwarf cooling bound for this coupling and excludes the range of values favoured by the axion hints from the anomalous cooling of Galactic white dwarfs.

      Alexei V. Filippenko","We present new transit timing measurements for the white dwarf-cold Jupiter system WD 1856+534, extending the baseline of observations from 311 epochs to 1498 epochs. The planet is unlikely to have survived the host star's red-giant phase at its present location and is likely too small for common-envelope evolution to take place. As such, a plausible explanation for the short semimajor axis is that the exoplanet started out on a much larger orbit and then spiraled inward through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HETM). A past transit-timing analysis found tentative evidence for orbital growth, which could have been interpreted as a residual effect of HETM, but we find the data are consistent with a constant-period model after adding 18 new transit measurements. We use the estimated period derivative $\dot{P} = 0.04\pm0.43$ ms yr$^{-1}$ to place a lower limit on the planetary tidal quality factor of $Q_p' \gtrsim 3.1 \times 10^6$, consistent with that of Jupiter in our own Solar System. We also test for the presence of companion planets in the system, which could have excited WD 1856 b onto an eccentric orbit via the Kozai-Lidov process, and ultimately rule out the presence of an additional planet with a mass greater than $4.1\,M_J$ and a period shorter than 1500 days. We find no evidence for nonzero eccentricity, with an upper limit of $e\lesssim10^{-2}$. If the planet indeed reached its current orbit through HETM, the low present-day eccentricity indicates that the migration process has now ceased, and any further orbital evolution will be governed solely by weak planetary tides.

      J. E. Horvath","Spider systems are a class of close binaries in which a neutron star first accretes from a normal companion, and later ablates it in some cases. New observations have expanded this category, with the addition of a Huntsman group, tentatively linked to a short donor phase along the red bump in the secondary evolutionary track. We present explicit evolutionary tracks that support the Huntsman nature recently suggested, and discuss how the whole class of spiders emerges from the full consideration of irradiation and ablating winds. We address the irradiation feedback (IFB) effects and the hydrogen-shell burning detachment (HSBD) simultaneously, and show that they act independently and do not interfere with each other, supporting a physical picture of the Huntsman group. We employ our binary evolution code to compute a suite of binary systems formed by a donor star and a neutron star for different initial orbital periods, assuming solar composition and Z=0.01. Although many models do not consider IFB, we also present the evolution with IFB for one system as an example. We found that the recently suggested association of Huntsman pulsar with the evolutionary stage where (as a consequence of the dynamics of HSBD) the system remains detached for a few million years is plausible. However, this feature alone is unable to account for the occurrence of Redback spider pulsars. Meanwhile, models including IFB, with pulsed mass transfer, display detachment episodes that can be naturally associated with the Redback stage. Irradiation feedback does not preclude or modify HSBD and in fact, Huntsman systems were already present as an implicit prediction in our earlier calculations. We conclude that Huntsman is an expected stage of the spider systems under quite general conditions. This is another step towards a unified picture of spider pulsars as a group.

We use $R_\mathrm{Hα}$ index (ratio of H$α$ luminosity to bolometric luminosity) to measure the H$α$ activity intensity of a spectrum, and utilize the median of the $R_\mathrm{Hα}$ values of multiple observations ($R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{median}$) as the representative activity intensity of a stellar source. The H$α$ variability of a stellar source is indicated by the extent of $R_\mathrm{Hα}$ fluctuation ($R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{EXT}$) of multiple observations. Our sample shows that $R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{EXT}$ of solar-like stars is about one order of magnitude smaller than $R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{median}$. The distribution of $\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{EXT}$ versus $\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{median}$ reveals the distinct behaviors between the stellar source categories with lower ($\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{median} < -4.85$) and higher ($\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{median} > -4.85$) activity intensity. For the former stellar source category, the top envelope of the distribution first increases and then decreases with $\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{median}$; while for the latter category, the top envelope of the distribution is largely along a positive correlation line. In addition, for the stellar sources with lower activity intensity, the large-$\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{EXT}$ objects near the top envelope of the $\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{EXT}$ versus $\log R_\mathrm{Hα}^\mathrm{median}$ distribution tend to have long-term and regular variations of H$α$ activity; while for the stellar sources with higher activity intensity, the H$α$ variations are more likely to be random fluctuations.

      P. A. Kołaczek-Szymański","In binary systems, studying tidal interactions is key to understanding the evolution of binary populations. The primary dissipation process occurring in stars with radiative envelopes is believed to be radiative damping of high-radial-order tidally excited oscillations, which is in agreement with observations of most binary systems. However, recent studies have suggested that outside this dissipation regime, dynamical tides can act in the opposite manner (a phenomenon known as inverse tides), and resonance locking could significantly impact the orbital evolution of binary systems. We aim to study inverse tides and resonance locking by simultaneously including the effect of all the forcing frequencies and accounting for the effect of the rotation on the forced oscillations. We have developed an orbital evolution code that is coupled to a stellar oscillation code to compute on the fly the impact of dynamical tides on the rotational and orbital evolution of binary systems including multiple simultaneous forcing frequencies. We find that resonance locking can be stable over a long period of time and a source of long-term exchange of angular momentum for rapidly rotating stars. Long-term locking can increase the total angular momentum of a fast-rotating star by approximately 70% during the main sequence. For slow-rotating stars, resonance locking can slow down the rotational evolution of the system over most of the main-sequence phase, even in the presence of strong tidal interactions. This mechanism efficiently drives asynchronisation in binary systems where significant discrepancies already exist between the orbital and rotational frequencies.

      Michaël De Becker","Shock types of low-velocity molecular outflows are not always well constrained. Astrochemical comparisons are often made between low-velocity and high-velocity outflows, but without considering the question of the shock type. We investigated molecular abundances of post-shock regions to determine whether strong differences between non-irradiated C-type and J-type shocks can be highlighted. One of the main application goals is to diagnose the shock type of the protostellar object L1157 B2 through the use of molecular tracers. We simulated grid sets of shock models with the Paris-Durham Shock code with velocities ranging from 5 to 19 km/s and low densities from $10^2$ to $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. We computed the desorption percentage of methanol in these simulations and estimated it at higher velocities. We compared our results to observational measurements of L1157 B2 and with a benchmark of four already identified shocks. L1157 B2 has been diagnosed as a non-irradiated C-type shock, and the method showed a good applicability through the benchmark. Methanol formed in the icy mantle of grains can serve to trace the differences between shock types, at least in non-irradiated conditions. A requirement for the applicability of a species as a shock-type tracer is that it does not undergo significant enhancement or destruction, but is mainly impacted by desorption processes under shocked conditions. The desorption percentage of methanol is a good criterion in characterizing the shock type of L1157 B2 and should be investigated as a general method to diagnose the shock type in non-irradiated regions. We identify L1157 B2 as a non-irradiated C-type shock with velocities and densities fitting with previous studies.

      , et al. (6 additional authors not shown)","Current-day multi-object spectroscopic surveys are often limited in their ability to observe bright stars due to their low surface densities, resulting in increased observational overheads and reduced efficiency. Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency.

We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| <= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N >= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.

For both FCs, the east foot-point roots in the active region (AR), while the west one roots in the remote quiet region. The bottom FC (FC1) appears as intermittent filaments. Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1$\times$10^{5} km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma.

The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2λ/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759λ/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date. Compared to previous BD multiplicity surveys with WFC3/IR, we achieve a 2.5$\times$ improvement in separation sensitivity at contrasts of 0-3 magnitudes in F127M. We have demonstrated that applying our improved technique to archival HST images of field BDs will thus probe down to separations of 1 au, in one of the largest high angular resolution surveys of such objects to date.

One of these environments is the S cluster, which consists of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars and the dusty G objects. While the majority of the brightest S stars can be classified as young B stars, the G sources can be described as dusty objects whose nature is still under debate. Aims. In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Brγ emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage. If present, a decrease in the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO on its descending part of the orbit would directly impact the direction of the debate about its nature.

Hennebelle","Context: The streaming instability (SI) is a leading candidate for reaching solid densities sufficient to trigger the gravitational collapse needed for the formation of planetesimals. However, dust growth barriers appear to impede the ability to assemble sufficiently large dust particles to trigger strong clumping, providing a serious impediment to planetesimal formation. Aims: We aim to address the possibility to enhance dust clumping with dust growth in SI-produced structures, and to estimate the impact of the shift of the dust fragmentation threshold in regions where the SI has enhanced the dust density. Methods: We perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of the SI with a monodisperse description of dust growth, accounting for the impact of mass loading of the dust on the sound speed of the gas and dust mixture when computing dust collisional velocities. Results: Dust mass loading reduces collision velocities in high density regions, allowing dust particles to survive to larger sizes before shattering. In turn, dust clumping is boosted as particles grow in size, as long as they remain sufficiently coupled to the gas. Conclusions: This two-way synergy between dust growth and clumping, which depends on the initial dust-to-gas ratio and dust elastic properties, allows denser dust clumps to form and thus facilitates the onset of planetesimal formation.

In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations.

Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $β$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns.

We present a homogeneous, NLTE spectroscopic analysis of 401 Galactic CCs, based on 1,351 high-resolution optical spectra, spanning Galactocentric distances from 4.6 to 29.3 kpc. Using PySME with MARCS atmospheres and state-of-the-art grids of NLTE departure coefficients, we derive atmospheric parameters and abundances for key species tracing multiple nucleosynthetic channels. Our sample-the largest CC NLTE dataset to date-achieves high internal precision and enables robust modeling of present-day thin-disk abundance patterns and radial gradients. We estimate abundance gradients using three analytic prescriptions (linear, logarithmic, bilinear with a break) within a Bayesian, outlier-robust framework, and we also apply Gaussian Process Regression to capture non-parametric variations. We find that NLTE atmospheric parameters differ systematically from LTE determinations. Moreover, iron and most elemental abundance profiles are better described by non-linear behavior rather than by single-slope linear models: logarithmic fits generally outperform simple linear models, while bilinear fits yield inconsistent break radii across elements. Gaussian Process models reveal a consistent outer-disk flattening of [X/H] for nearly all studied elements. The [X/Fe] ratios are largely flat with Galactocentric radius, indicating coherent chemical scaling with iron across the thin disk, with modest positive offsets for Na and Al and mild declines for Mn and Cu. Comparison with recent literature shows overall agreement but highlights NLTE-driven differences, especially in outer-disk abundances. These results provide tighter empirical constraints for chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and set the stage for future NLTE mapping with upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.

It aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind solar eruptions and coronal heating, and to directly measure the coronal magnetic field. The mission will perform in situ measurements of the current sheet between coronal mass ejections and their associated solar flares, and energetic particles produced by either reconnection or fast-mode shocks driven by coronal mass ejections. This will help to resolve the nature of reconnections in current sheets, and energetic particle acceleration regions. To investigate coronal heating, the mission will observe nano-flares on scales smaller than 70 km in the solar corona and regions smaller than 40 km in the photosphere, where magnetohydrodynamic waves originate. To study solar wind acceleration mechanisms, the mission will also track the process of ion charge-state freezing in the solar wind. A key achievement will be the observation of the coronal magnetic field at unprecedented proximity to the solar photosphere. The polar regions will also be observed at close range, and the inner edge of the solar system dust disk may be identified for the first time. This work presents the detailed background, science, and mission concept of SCOPE and discusses how we aim to address the questions mentioned above.

Interstellar dust is also directly observed in the vicinity of the Sun with dust detectors onboard spacecraft, and it is known to be affected by the interplanetary magnetic field. The main goal of this work is to show how the change in the interplanetary magnetic field with the solar cycle affects the infrared picture of the heliosphere. To compose a synthetic intensity map of the interstellar dust thermal emission, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate the distribution of the dust particles inside the heliosphere. We considered the effects of the heliosphere boundaries and the non-stationary current sheet. The change in the Parker magnetic field caused by the solar activity cycle leads distinguishable features in the mid-infrared emission maps of the heliosphere. The distribution of the interstellar dust in the vicinity of the Sun we calculated suggests that small particles linger outside of the heliosphere, and medium-size particles are mostly affected by the changing interplanetary magnetic field, which leads to number density waves in the tail region of the heliosphere. Finally, large particles form a bulge behind the Sun.

Preliminary analysis of the data shows that BBWLC imaged the Kcorona with three streamer structures on the west limb of the Sun. To further confirm the coronal signals obtained by BBWLC, comparisonswere made with observations of the Kcoronagraph of the High Altitude Observatory and the Atmospheric ImagingAssembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory.

This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback. Finally, we analyzed its impact on the marginal posterior distribution.

      Stéphane Udry","A question that continues to perplex astronomers is the formation of tight stellar binaries. There is too much angular momentum in a collapsing and fragmenting protostellar cloud to form a stellar binary in situ with a separation less than an AU, yet thousands of these short-period binaries have been discovered. One indication of a binary's formation is the angle between the stellar spin and orbital axes -- its obliquity. The classical method for determining projtected stellar obliquity is the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. This method has been applied to over 100 hot Jupiters, yet only a handful of stellar binaries. Of the binary systems with measured projected obliquities, even fewer have measured 3D obliquities. In this paper, we add five more short-period binary 3D obliquity measurements to the sample that previously consisted of a single system. We present Rossiter-McLaughlin measurements for EBLM J0239-20, EBLM J0941-31, EBLM 1037-25, EBLM 1141-37, and EBLM J2025-45. These systems consist of an M-dwarf eclipsing an F/G type primary. We combined CORALIE and HARPS spectroscopy with TESS photometry of primary and secondary eclipses. We show that even though the sky-projected obliquities seem to be aligned, there is modest but non-zero spin-orbit misalignment ($ψ$ between 5 and 20$^{\circ}$). Our primary stars straddle the Kraft break at $\sim 6250K$. Finally, we derive the M-dwarf masses and radii to precisions better than 3\%. With the exception of EBLM J0941-31, each system has an inflated radius greater than $5σ$ from the expected radius from stellar models.

"The Kinematic Properties of TŻO Candidate HV 11417 with Gaia DR3","      
      Anna J. G. O'Grady","HV 11417 is a candidate Thorne-Żytkow Object, a red supergiant with a neutron star core, located within the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Previous studies have questioned, using Gaia DR2 data, whether HV 11417 was truly located at the distance of the SMC or was instead a foreground star. However, the proper motion measurement uncertainties for HV 11417 in DR2 were high. In this work, we use Gaia DR3 data to show that HV 11417 is very likely to be a true member of the SMC. We further analyze the kinematics of HV 11417 relative to its local environment, and compare it to populations of massive and evolved stars in the SMC. We find HV 11417 has a local transverse velocity of $52\pm15$ km/s, and thus qualifies as a runaway star (v$_\mathrm{loc}\geq$ 30 km/s). This runaway classification does not conclusively prove its nature as a TŻO, particularly given results from recent TŻO models, but does indicate that HV 11417 experienced a kinematic disruption in its evolution.

These systems are known to host disks with Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian dynamics and to drive outflows of gas escaping from the rotating disk. These binary post-AGB stars can be categorized into two subclasses depending on the predominance of specific kinematic components: disk-dominated and outflow-dominated sources. We present the survey of such sources observed in CO using the IRAM-30m telescope, in which we aim to identify the molecular gas in these circumbinary-disk-containing post-AGB nebulae. We aim to analyze the mass distribution of the disk objects studied in CO. We present high-sensitivity mm-wave observations of the CO line emission from ten binary post-AGB stars. Using the derived formulation and observational data, we calculated the mass of the total gas in the CO-emitting regions of these nebulae. The logarithmic distribution of nebular masses was analyzed using a normal model that incorporates censored data, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and yielding more accurate and representative results. CO emission is detected in six post-AGB nebulae from our sample. We have significantly increased the sample of observed sources in CO lines. Some of these objects exhibit very weak molecular emission. Within the sample of disk-containing sources, the total gas mass spans a range of 1E-4 to 1E-1 Mo. The results derived from this work, along with those from a previous CO single-dish survey and interferometric data, show that this class of binary post-AGB stars exhibits a large range of nebular masses (including both the rotating disk and the expanding component), with variations exceeding a factor of 600. The typical nebular mass of these objects, accounting for both detections and non-detections through censored data analysis, is approximately 2E-3 Mo.

We use the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate populations of CCSNe across a wide range of metallicities and binary evolution assumptions. Our models vary the prescriptions for mass transfer stability, common envelope ejection efficiency, natal kick strength, and remnant mass-limited explodability to assess their impact on the resulting population of CCSNe. We find that reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate requires either low common envelope efficiency or modified prescriptions for common envelope survival, highlighting the importance of stellar mergers in shaping the CCSN population. We further classify our synthetic CCSNe into subtypes and present their relative abundances using several different sets of classification criteria, highlighting the large uncertainties that persist in mapping progenitor properties to spectral classes. Finally, we present delay time distributions (DTDs) for our overall populations, separated into Type I and II, and into the full set of observed subtypes. Our DTDs show that models reproducing the observed Type I to Type II rate produce a larger fraction of late CCSNe than is expected under standard assumptions.

While many studies on astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric properties of BSSs in clusters have been conducted, there are few works in the literature regarding their pulsations and internal structure, which indeed can retain traces of their origin. In this work we computed and analysed a grid of collisional BSSs at low metallicity ($Z = 0.01\; Z_\odot$), finding that collision products present a peculiar chemical stratification that leads to periodicities in the period spacing pattern of high-order gravity modes. These seismic fingerprints provide a unique opportunity to constrain the formation pathways of BSSs in globular clusters.

Using a general circulation model, we demonstrate that VHS 1256B's atmosphere is dominated by planetary-scale dust storms persisting for tens of days, with large patchy clouds propagating with equatorial waves. This weather pattern, distinct from the banded structures seen on solar system giants, simultaneously explains the observed spectra and critical features in the rotational light curves, including the large amplitude, irregular evolution, and wavelength dependence, as well as the variability trends observed in near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of dusty substellar atmospheres.

Understanding the temporally and spectrally resolved activity of such stars is essential for assessing their impact on planetary environments. Aims. We aim to examine in detail state-of-the-art concepts of flare models to identify what is missing in our understanding of energy deposition during the flare event. By comparing synthetic and observed flare spectra, we seek to determine the modelling frameworks best suited to represent flare energetics and spectral far-ultraviolet features while providing a foundation for investigating flare impacts on exoplanet atmospheres. Methods. In this work, we built the Young M Dwarfs Flare (YMDF) model utilising the combination of radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) stellar atmosphere models with a high and low-energy electron beam and corresponding synthetic observables. These models are based on physical principles and were validated with solar and stellar observations. Results. The newly developed YMDF model reproduces the observed continuum rise in both the TESS photometric band and the FUV-A spectral range. Furthermore, the flare distributions generated within this framework show consistency with those observed in our sample of stars. Conclusions. We have developed the YMDF model as a tool to reproduce the time-dependent spectra of flaring young M dwarfs, providing a physically motivated description of their spectral and temporal evolution during flare events.

One peculiar feature is that the lighter $s$-process elements (e.g., Zr and Mo) present larger anomalies than the heavier $s$-process elements (e.g., Nd and W). To address this observation, we compared Zr and Nd data to model predictions of the s-process abundances at the surface of low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of initial metallicity from solar to twice solar. We found that the relative magnitude of the isotopic variability between these two elements can be matched by models of AGB stars of super-solar metallicity. The match is favoured by stronger convective overshoot, leading to a deeper dredge-up of the H-rich envelope into the He-rich region, and/or a smaller (~ half than standard) mass of the region rich in the $^{13}$C nuclei that produce free neutrons via the $^{13}$C($α$,n)$^{16}$O reaction. We conclude that nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can match the difference in the magnitude of the bulk meteoritic variations in Zr and Nd, provided that super-solar metallicity stars are the original site of these signatures. The AGB stars that produced such variations could have belonged to the current population of old, super-solar metallicity stars seen in the galactic solar neighbourhood.

All three components of the system are O- or B-type stars. We carried out a comprehensive study of the system, based on light curves from TESS and other instruments, a new series of echelle spectra, older spectra from the ESO archive, and several VLTI interferometric observations. Due to the large amount of different types of data covering both orbits in the system, we obtained a more precise value of the long orbital period ($1603.24\pm0.19$ d) and fully determined all other orbital parameters. Although both orbits are eccentric, their period ratio is large enough for the system to be dynamically stable. The inner and outer orbits are in the same plane, which means that no Kozai-Lidov mechanism is acting in the system. Assuming solar metallicity in our MESA models, we found ages of $(4.4\pm 0.1)$, $(4.7\pm 0.2)$, and $(3.8\pm1.3)$ Myr for the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary, respectively. Our evolutionary scenario predicts that the inner eclipsing binary will merge within approximately 1.7 Myr and eventually evolve into a black hole. The distance to the system, estimated from the angular size of the outer orbit is $(809.9 \pm 1.8)$ pc, which implies that $δ$ Cir might be located close to the centre of a stellar population ASCC 79, a subgroup of the young Circinus complex. With a total mass of $(53.04\pm0.29)$ M$_{\odot}$, $δ$ Cir can contribute a significant fraction of the total mass of the population.

We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.

Analysis of VPHAS+ and Pan-STARRS imaging, combined with optical and infrared spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope and ESO New Technology Telescope, further reveals that the symbiotic star has been misidentified in the literature. We identify the correct counterpart as \textit{Gaia} DR3 4061345440488592896 (=OGLE-BLG-LPV-241932), a Mira with a 161-day period. Its infrared spectrum displays prominent emission lines and is remarkably similar to those of other symbiotic Miras.

The early-time light curves of SN 2021ukt exhibit a ~25 day plateau. Such a short phase of hydrogen recombination suggests a rather thin H-rich outer envelope of the progenitor star. The relatively narrow Balmer emission lines in spectra of SN 2021ukt during the first week indicate the interaction between the expanding ejecta and the immediate circumstellar material (CSM). This Hα line is observed throughout its helium-rich ejecta-dominated phase and nebular phase, suggesting persistent interaction with a radially extended CSM profile. We explore the synthetic light-curve model among grids of parameters generated by MESA+STELLA. We also compare the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2021ukt with several well-sampled supernovae that exhibit a short plateau and persistent ejecta-CSM interaction. An estimate of the progenitor mass of SN 2021ukt is made based on the flux ratio between [Ca II] λλ 7291, 7324 and [O I] λλ 6300, 6364 during its nebular phase. Our analysis suggests that the progenitor star of SN 2021ukt has a zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass of about 12 solar masses, a mass of radioactive nickel-56 synthesized in the SN ejecta of about 0.04 solar masses, and a mass of the H-rich envelope of about 0.5 solar masses. This study adds to the growing sample of transitional supernovae, reinforcing evidence for a continuum of underrepresented progenitors whose evolutionary pathways lie between those of standard SN models.

This behavior is consistent with mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star in the system, and the corresponding mass-transfer rate is estimated to be \(\dot{M} = -(4.62 \pm 1.54)\times10^{-8}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}\). Light curve modeling with the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code, refined through MCMC sampling, confirms an overcontact configuration and yields a mass ratio of q=3.987. A cool photospheric starspot on the cooler component is required to reproduce the observed O'Connell asymmetry.

"A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter","      
      Mannque Rho","How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $ω$-$σ$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry. I follow the bottom-up approach from chiral symmetry with pions, coupled to hidden local and scale symmetry degrees of freedom. Exploiting the renormalization-group treatment à la Shankar and Polchinski of the fermionic interactions on the Fermi sphere, leading to Landau-Migdal Fermi-liquid, one obtains a sort of generalized ``Density Functional"" that allows via a topology change hadrons transform to quarks without phase changes at the center of massive stars. The highly dense matter is ``pseudo-conformal"" with the sound velocity $v_{pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$ but the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is not equal to zero, hence the matter is non-conformal.
